1046478	You have just slain your first 'Horde Minion'.  Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself, if need be.
1046477	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Horde Minion' in the cage near the water fountain.
1046476	You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Horde Minions'. I am pleased.
1046475	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Horde Minions'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.

1046428	There are 8 types of reagent: Mandrake, Nightshade, Black Pearl, Sulfurous Ash, Spider's Silk, Garlic, Ginseng and Bloodmoss.
1046427	You do not have enough reagents to safely go on.  You should acquire at least 35 of each reagent.
1046426	I have drawn you a picture to the left of what the sign on Aegis' Shop looks like. It should help you find it a little easier.
1046425	Aegis' Shop
1046424	I only have runes marked for near the Moongate, but the sextant will help you find the rest of the way.
1046423	I can open a Moongate for you from here to an area close to the Moongate that can take you to the city of Moonglow.
1046422	Congratulations! You've completed all of your quests!
1046421	Moonglow is where Aegis is waiting for you in his shop.
1046420	You have found a Moongate.  Remember to choose 'Moonglow' as your destination when you step into the gate.
1046419	One more thing before you depart for battle:
1046418	If your health drops too low, you should heal yourself with bandages or healing potions.  Heal yourself often, and you should have no trouble surviving.
1046417	To bring up your status bar, single click yourself and drag away from your avatar.  Double click the status bar to see details.
1046416	During combat it is important to keep an eye on your hit points.  Should they ever drop below 0, you will die.
1046415	~1_bulkname~ / ~2_amountreq~ ~3_intamount~ / ~4_excep~ / ~5_ingottype~ / ~6_itemname~
1046414	the remains of ~1_NAME~
1046413	By naming all of your runes to something that is meaningful to you, you can keep your rune library organized and easy to use.
1046412	Once you have double clicked the rune, you will get a text prompt.  Enter the new description and press the [enter] key on your keyboard.
1046411	Looking at the rune (single click) will give you the description of the rune.  If you wish to change the default description, simply double click the rune.
1046410	Target the rune you wish to mark and single click it.  If your spell is successful, the rune will sparkle and will from then on be 'marked'.
1046409	Then you cast the mark spell (either from a scroll or your spellbook, as I have explained earlier).  Once the spell is cast you will get a targeting cursor.
1046408	To mark a rune, you must stand in the place where you wish to appear when casting the 'Recall' or 'Gate' spell.
1046407	Marking runes is easy.  I'll give you a quick explanation of how it works, then I would advise that you mark a rune somewhere around my mansion so you can return quickly.
1046406	I have drawn you a picture of what the Reagent Shop sign looks like (left).   Remember that you can also look at (single click) shop signs to read them.
1046405	You have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046404	You now have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.
1046403	Before going into battle, you should always check your reagent supply and make sure you have your spell icons set up.
1046402	Once a spell icon is in the game window, it will stay there even if you close the spellbook.  This is an easy way to set up many spells for quick casting.
1046401	Another way of casting a spell is to click on that spell's spell icon.  You can drag any spell's icon off of the book and place it anywhere in the game window.
1046400	Single clicking on a spell name will give you all the details of the spell.  You can see the aforementioned reagent requirements as well as the spell's icon.
1079101	Not at all, just starting!
1046399	You can double click any of the spell names to make an attempt at casting that spell.  To see a spell's reagent requirements, single click on the spell name.
1046398	You can turn pages by single clicking the corner in the top right hand side of the spellbook, or you can single click on the circled numbers on the bottom to jump to specific circle.
1046397	To actually cast a spell from your spellbook, you must first open your spellbook (double click).  This opens the book to the 1st & 2nd circle spells.
1046396	The 1st circle of spells is the easiest of spells to cast (and also has the least mana requirement) whilst 8th circle spells are difficult even for a Grandmaster Mage.
1046395	Casting spells from a spellbook AND casting spells from scrolls requires a certain amount of mana. The actual amount of mana required differs from circle to circle.
1046394	To cast a spell from a spellbook, the necessary reagents are required (listed with the spell in your spellbook). 
1046393	Two: You can drop the scroll on to your spellbook where it will be permanently written.  You can then cast the spell from your spellbook any time you wish.
1046392	One: You can cast the spell by using (double click) the scroll.  No spell reagents (ingredients) are required to cast spells from scrolls. Casting from a scroll consumes the scroll.
1046391	Most often, spells start out as scrolls written by either NPC or Player scribes.  Once a spell has been successfully scribed, you have two choices:
1046390	To make your attack, you will most likely wish to use your magical powers, so allow me to give you a brief explanation of magic.
1046389	To make it easier to find the Treasure, be sure to use your radar map.
1046388	Locate the bank and find the NPC Banker (or Minter) inside.  Then, say the word 'Bank' and place your check into your bank box and double click it.
1046387	Farewell.
1046386	May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.  We shall no doubt see each other again.
1046385	I've no tasks for you to complete, and you are free to adventure in the world on your own.
1046384	That's pretty much all there is to banking.  I bet you are eager to explore the world, so I won't hold you up any longer.
1046383	The safest place for any of your goods, is your bank box.  No one can access it except for you.
1046382	That is to say, your bank box, along with any goods you placed into it,  is accessible from any bank in the land.
1046381	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place in to a bank box anywhere, can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1046380	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1046379	To open your bank box, you must be near a Banker or Minter and say the word 'Bank'.
1046378	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1046377	Go now to cash your check.  The person cashing your check will explain the details of Britannia's banking system to you.
1046376	There is a bank not too far from here, Southeast of this shop, actually.  Banks are often crowded with people conducting business.
1046375	Place the check into your bank box and double click it to cash it.  Bankers and Minters can be found inside of banks across the world.
1046374	Cashing a check is very easy.  All you have to do is locate a NPC Banker or Minter, walk near them and say the word 'Bank'.
1046373	NPC shop keepers do not accept checks as payment.  Checks are a handy way to transport large sums of money without having to lug all that gold around.
1046372	Actually, before you can spend this money, you will have to take the check to a bank and cash it.
1046371	Once you emerge from the Moongate, the city will be roughly to the north.  It should not be difficult to find.  Find Aegis and speak with him once you are in the city..
1046370	May good luck and fortune guide your way.
1046369	The teleporter to the caves is against the north wall of this room.
1046368	To help you find the location of the treasure, you should become familiar with the Radar Map.
1079068	Hey! Are you alright?
1046367	Choose the 'Quest Log' option, and any information pertinent to your current quest status will be shown to you.
1046366	Speaking of context menus, you can bring up the status of your quest by bringing up your avatar's own context menu (single left, or shift-left click yourself).
1046365	After you have indicated to the vendor that you wish to purchase something, you will be shown a list of the goods they have to offer.

1046361	You have not made two pickaxes.  Come back and show me your work when you have both completed.
1046360	Why are you giving me this?  You need to make pickaxes!
1046359	You can close the map by right clicking on it.  Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.
1046358	Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little.  The map shows you your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.
1046357	The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.

1046300	This yellow potion needs to be in your backpack before you may use it.
1046299	No one is allowed to enter this cave from here.
1046298	This mongbat does not have your gold. You need to find the mongbat that highlights grey.
1046297	You may not loot this mongbat. Find the one that took your gold.
1046296	That is not a book
1046295	Target the book you wish to copy.
1046294	To rejoin the world of the living simply walk near one of the NPC healers, and they will resurrect you as long as you are not marked as a criminal.
1046293	While you are still in young status, you will be transported to the nearest healer (along with your items) at the time of your death.
1046292	To be resurrected you must find a healer in town or wandering in the wilderness.  Some powerful players may also be able to resurrect you.
1046291	Since you are a new player, any items you had on your person at the time of your death will be in your backpack upon resurrection.
1046290	No one can understand what you say whilst you are dead, unless they are using the 'Spirit Speak' skill to understand your words.
1046289	You can pass through doors as though they do not exist.  However, you cannot pass through walls.
1046288	As a ghost you cannot interact with the world. You cannot touch items nor can you use them.
1046287	You have died.
1046286	Simply walk up to the appropriate vendor and say the words 'Vendor Buy', or use the vendor's context menu.
1046285	Potions, however, can be costly and require a free hand to drink.  Purchasing any of these items is easy.
1046284	Bandages are very cost-effective. Of course, you could also drink a healing potion (yellow) to heal your damage.
1046283	Use bandages on yourself (double click bandages and target yourself) any time your hit points get too low.
1046282	Cloth can be purchased from tailors and can be cut up with scissors to create bandages.
1046281	Don't spend all your money on armor though, as you will no doubt at some time wish to purchase bolts of cloth for bandages.
1046280	It may be wise to purchase some equipment from him.  I would suggest armor made of ringmail and perhaps a shield.
1046279	Please also note the blacksmith standing next to the magic teleporter. He sells armor and weapons.
1046278	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Headless' in the cage near the water fountain
1046277	Now please go. Time is short, dear friend.
1046276	The monsters that you will encounter outside of this mansion, however will highlight grey, which means you can freely attack them.
1046275	Needless to say, becoming a criminal in town will most certainly be detrimental to your health.
1046274	If the name is in blue, then you may not attack them without becoming a criminal.
1046273	You can find out if a creature is attackable or not by the color of their name when you look at them (single click).
1046272	However, be sure to not attack the monsters in the cage as they are currently under the protection of the town guards.
1078969	Friend removed: '%1'
1046271	On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Shadow Wisp' in the cage near the water fountain.
1046270	I have made the necessary adjustments to the Teleporter here. Step on to it when you are ready to depart.
1046269	Seek out Aegis in Moonglow and see if he can transport you to the new location of his captured apprentice.
1046268	Unfortunately, evil mages have relocated the prisoner to another camp.  Aegis has information on their whereabouts.
1046267	I have adjusted the magical teleporter to take you back.  Step onto the teleporter when you are ready.
1046266	What misfortunes have befallen you that you would return without completing your task?
1046265	The sextant refuses to be picked up by you
1046264	Once you find a Moongate, step into it and choose Moonglow as your destination.
1046263	Take this enchanted sextant to help guide you on your journey back. Double click the sextant to show you the way to the nearest Moongate.
1046262	I can unfortunately not travel with you, but I have something that will help you find your way.
1046261	That's not enough my friend.  I need 75.  No less.
1046260	You need to clear some space in your inventory to continue with the quest.  Come back here when you have more space in your inventory.
1046259	Haven
1046258	Your quest is complete.
1046257	Are you sure you want to release your pet? Pets summoned from Statues and Prisms will vanish permanently!
1046256	I have placed some bandages and heal potions in your pack, compliments of the villagers.
1046255	I've given you a bag with some black, night sight potions. Drink them to see in the dark.  I've also included a few heal potions.
1046254	You have excavated the treasure. Return to Uzeraan.
1046253	Quest Complete!  You have found the treasure and have slain the guardians. Return to Uzeraan.
1046252	Find and dig up the treasure.  Slay the guardians and take the booty that is rightfully yours.
1046251	Go forth and kill at least 6 of the 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find evidence of our missing men.
1046250	Take this magical sword.  It is a mighty fine weapon.  It will serve you well in your conquest against evil.
1046249	I foresee that you will become a mighty warrior.  I see fortune and glory on your path!
1046248	Well done young fighter! Stay on the path of virtue and glory and honor will be yours.
1046247	Slay his captors and free him!  May your road to glory be paved with the blood of our oppressors.  Go now.
1046246	Come back here after you have made the necessary arrangements and I will teleport you - providing I find the blasted rune.
1046245	Gather your weapon, armor and I suggest at least 30 bandages before you return.
1046244	Good luck, young fighter! I hope you succeed!  May the aethers have mercy on us if you do not.
1046243	Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046242	We once used one of the caves below the island for mining purposes.
1046241	You have done well against the guardians of the treasure!  I feel I can entrust you with yet another quest.
1046240	You must slay all of the guardians before you can open the treasure chest.  Return here after you have completed the treasure hunt.
1078936	Channel %1 renamed to %2.
1046239	If you are digging in the right spot, the chest will emerge, and the treasure's guardians will emerge.
1046238	3. Target the spot on the ground where the treasure is buried
1046237	2. Target the Treasure map
1046236	1. Double click your shovel
1046235	Once you have found the spot, you will need to follow these steps to bring up the treasure:
1046234	Take heed though, the magic of the sextant will only work for you. Don't give it away!
1046233	Press ALT-R to bring up your overhead map.  Then you can double click the enchanted sextant to tell you the way.
1046232	You're standing right on top of the spot!
1046231	The treasure should be here on this island somewhere. I've also given you an enchanted sextant that will help you find your way.
1046230	You need to clear some space in your backpack to continue with the quest.  Visit Uzeraan when you have more space in your backpack.
1046229	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithing skill a couple of points.
1046228	To show me a pickaxe you have made, drag the pickaxe onto me and I will review your crafted pickaxe.
1046227	I'm sorry but it seems your backpack is too full to accept your reward. Come back when you have room for it.
1046226	an enchanted sextant
1046225	* the magic fails *
1046224	It's North-West from here
1046223	It's West from here
1046222	It's South-West from here
1046221	It's South from here
1046220	It's South-East from there
1046219	It's East from here
1046218	It's North-East from here
1046217	It's North from here
1046216	I can teleport you close to where the treasure should be buried
1046215	Take the treasure map and this shovel.  Double click the treasure map, located in your pack, to see where the treasure is. X marks the spot.
1046214	It's a treasure map I received from a dragon tamer a long time ago. I have neither the time nor the patience to find the treasure.
1046213	Return here when you are ready to depart and I will transport you into the caverns below the island.
1046212	Go and gather supplies for battle. I suggest you take your weapon, some armor and at least 25 bandages to be safe.
1046211	I can use this recall rune to transport you directly into the caverns. Alas, you must find your own way out.
1046210	Well there is *ONE* way - Yes! That is it. Whilst I was installing the teleporter I marked a recall rune in the cave!
1046209	You however, have shown great valor in your battle against the 'Headless'!
1046208	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Headless'.
1078903	This no need, do not mislead!
1046207	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046206	We believe the vile 'Headless' are responsible for these disappearances.
1046205	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 50 of each reagent.
1046204	Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 35 of each reagent.
1046203	I have some unfinished business before I can return home.  Fare thee well kind adventurer.
1046202	Now I can finally return to my family.  Will you go and tell Aegis that I am free and that I did not give away the secret of the new spell.
1046201	You have requested to cancel your quest.  Once you have cancelled your quest, you cannot start the young player quest again.  Do you wish to cancel your quest?
1046200	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1046199	Once you have completed the deeds, Uzeraan will grant you a reward.
1046198	After the deeds have all been completed, travel through the moongate to Haven and find Uzeraan.
1046197	Use the combine button in the opened deed window to combine your finished products with the deed.  When you have finished the amount the orders are for, drag the deed onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.
1046196	The grey order deeds can be double-clicked to open them up and read what the amount and type of items are needed by the armourers.  Forge the items as you did for the ringmail tunic earlier with your blacksmithing hammer.
1046195	If you pass through town, the mountains are to the north-east of Minoc.  You can use those mountains to mine the ore you need for ingots and blacksmithing.
1046194	The armourers have two shops in town.  They both have forges and anvils in them that you can use to make the weapons and armor in your order deeds.
1046193	Minoc is to the north-west of the gate you have just exited from.  There is a road to the west that leads north into town.
1046192	The city of Minoc is a city of miners, tinkerers, and jewelers.  Minoc is to the north-northwest.  The mountains are north-east of Minoc.  You need to complete the order deeds in Minoc.
1046191	Select Trammel as the facet you wish to visit and then select Minoc as the city.  
1046190	To visit Minoc, you may visit it in either Trammel or Felucca.  Although, the armourers that need the weapons and armor are in Trammel.
1046189	The city of Haven is in Trammel.  If you wish to travel back to Haven, you would need to select Trammel before selecting it as the city you wish to visit.
1046188	Besides allowing you to travel between locations, you may use a moongate to go to another facet.  The two facets are Felucca and Trammel.
1046187	If you cannot walk into the moongate, you may double-click it to use it.  If you are too far from the moongate, you cannot use the moongate.
1046186	The other type of moongate does not offer a menu.  It is a moongate that powerful mages may temporarily create to allow themselves and others to pass through them to marked locations.
1046185	There are two types of moongates.  Moongates, such as the one you just found, are scattered through the world and offer menus of different locations.
1046184	Now that you have found the moongate, you should walk into it.  A menu will appear asking where you wish to travel to.
1046183	The moongate allows you to travel to far destinations.  Select Trammel and then Minoc and accept the menu and it will whisk you away.  Once there, walk west towards the road.
1046182	To get to the city of Minoc, you will need to travel through the moongate.  The moongate is located to the south-east of town, towards the mountains.
1046181	Now, I have a more advanced task for you.  The city armourers of Minoc are in need of weapons and armor.  I have placed their order deeds in your backpack for you to fulfill.
1046180	Uzeraan says: You have done very well.  You know how to supply yourself with iron ingots and pickaxes.
1046179	Uzeraan describes the order deeds the armourers need in Minoc.  Find the moongate at the south-east part of town.  This moongate will take you to a location just outside of Minoc.
1046178	Once you have completed the ingots, visit me for your payment.
1046177	Iron ore piles are heavy.  You will need to lug piles of ore you mine back to the mansion to smelt them into iron ingots.  This may take you a few trips back and forth between the mountains and the forge.
1046176	Please make fifty ingots and bring them to me.  I will buy them from you for five-hundred gold.
1078870	House Management - Access
1046175	Uzeraan says:  Now that you know how to keep your pickaxes in good supply and how to make iron ingots, I happen to be in need of a large pile of ingots.
1046174	Make fifty iron ingots for the mansion.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed making the ingots.
1046173	You can make these pickaxes anywhere, as long as you have the ingots.  This means if you ever run out of pickaxes while mining a mountainside, you can make more pickaxes right away!
1046172	To make a couple of pickaxes, you can use your tinker tools on your ingots.  Select the pickaxe from the tinker menu and it will be made from the ingots you selected.
1046171	Shovels and pickaxes break fairly often while mining.  This means you will need to make pickaxes with the ingots you mine up
1046170	Make two pickaxes for mining with your tinker kit.  Show Uzeraan a pickaxe by giving it to him.
1046169	When you have made the iron ingots, visit Uzeraan and he will instruct you on how to make more pickaxes.
1046168	Once you find the forge, double-click the piles of ore and target the red coals of the forge.  The ore will be smelted into ingots, if you are close enough to the forge.
1046167	Uzeraan says: Now that you have the five piles of ore, you will need to smelt them.  The forge allows you to smelt ore.
1046166	Smelt ore in town at the forge for iron ingots.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ingots.
1046165	Uzeraan's forge can be used to smelt ore into iron ingots.  Those ingots can be used to make tools.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ore.
1046164	Ore comes in varying sizes.  The smaller the pile, the fewer ingots it will make when it is smelted.  You will need five large piles of iron ore to smelt into the ingots you need.
1046163	If an area is out of ore, you will need to hunt further along a mountainside or in a cave for more spots to mine at.  Simply use your digging tool on different areas of the stone until you get some ore.
1046162	To mine ore, you will need to use your shovel or pickaxe on the mountainside or on a cave floor.  Double-clicking the shovel or pickaxe allows you to use the item.  You can then target the mountain or cave floor.
1046161	Once you have completed mining five large iron ore piles from mountains or caves, visit Uzeraan.  There are four types of ore piles, the largest pile smelts for the most ingots.
1046160	Once you find the mountains, you can mine them with your trusty shovel or pickaxe.
1046159	There are mountains to the south of my mansion.  They may be dangerous, so make sure to wear your ringmail tunic before you leave.
1046158	Uzeraan says: Now that you have made a ringmail tunic, you will need more ingots to supply yourself for future armor and weapons you make.  Ingots are made from ore that you mine off of mountains.
1046157	Uzeraan explains why you need the ringmail tunic for protection.  The mountains south of the mansion have ore to mine, but may have a critter or two that are hostile.
1046156	Visit Uzeraan once you have made your ringmail tunic.
1046155	If you are too far from the anvil and forge, you will not get the menu.  If you do not have enough ingots in your backpack for the item you want to smith, then you will not be able to make it.
1046154	The tongs or hammer you use are in your backpack or hand. Double-clicking the tongs or hammer should bring up a menu to allow you to blacksmith.
1046153	To use an anvil and forge, you must be standing next to them.  An anvil and forge allows you to use tongs or a hammer.
1046152	At the forge and anvil, you craft the items of your blacksmithing trade.  To protect yourself, you should craft a ringmail tunic.
1046151	Forge a ringmail tunic with your smithy hammer or tongs.  Uzeraan has more information, once you make the ringmail tunic.
1046150	First, I would like you to find an anvil and forge.  The anvils and forges can be found on this floor of my mansion.
1046149	These tasks will help you to become a better blacksmith and make tools to aid your smithing.  The tasks are not pointless, as an army needs the weapons and armor you make.
1046148	Uzeraan says: Hello!  I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan.  I have a few tasks I'd like you to perform.
1046147	Uzeraan explains tasks for you to become a better blacksmith.  He has requested that you find an anvil and forge.
1046146	Uzeraan lives in his mansion within the city of Haven.  Find him and he will give you instructions on tasks he would like you to do for him.
1046145	Return to Aegis and tell him you have freed his apprentice.
1046144	Find the prison camp where the abducted apprentice is being held. Slay his oppressors and free him.
1078837	Your backpack is full! Please make room and try again.
1046143	Check in with Aegis after a while to see if he has recovered the rune to the prison camp.
1046142	Explore the town and gather supplies for battle. Return to Aegis when you are ready.
1046141	Find Aegis the Archmage in the city of Moonglow. His shop is west of the teleporter park.
1046140	Gather any supplies you need and return to Uzeraan when you are ready to leave for Moonglow.
1046139	Find the teleporter in the cave and return to Uzeraan.
1046138	Venture into the mining cave and slay 6 of the restless souls. Use the teleporter in the cave to return.
1046137	Gather supplies for battle and return to Uzeraan when you are ready.
1046136	Find 75 Mandrake roots and return them to Uzeraan. Try checking the local reagent shops.
1046135	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046134	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.
1046133	Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.
1046132	I hope we meet again in the future my friend. I am indebted to you always.
1046131	Take this magical wizard's hat. It tends to be rough on the body, but does wonders for the mind.
1046130	Gold is also always welcome I think, so here is a check for 1000 gold. Don't squander it now, ye hear?
1046129	I thank you for saving my apprentice and therein saving our cause. I feel a reward is in order.
1046128	I foresee that you will become a mighty spell wielder who will gain many honors throughout Britannia.
1046127	Well done young Mage!!!  Stay on the path of virtue and continue your lessons in the arcane arts.
1046126	Aegis smiles at you with a look of great satisfaction.
1046125	Quest Complete! You have saved the apprentice.  Return to Aegis and speak with him.
1046124	Now go. Time is short!  Return here when you have saved my apprentice.
1046123	Also keep in mind that not only doors can be locked with the lock spell, but also containers of all sorts.
1046122	Remember however, that the Unlock spell only unlocks things that were locked using the 'Magic Lock' spell.
1046121	They are scrolls with the 'Unlock' spell inscribed upon them.  This spell can be very useful.
1046120	Slay his captors and release him from his bondage. Take these scrolls with you - they will help.
1046119	I will transport you now to the location that was inscribed on this rune. I pray it takes you to my student wizard.
1046118	My ancestors smile upon me. I have found the rune to the prison camp.  With this rune we can find the lost apprentice.
1046117	Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the rune yet. Please return in a few minutes. I will keep looking.
1046116	Go and fetch yourself some supplies for the forthcoming battle and I will continue my search for the rune.
1046115	I have the rune right here. No?  Maybe in this pocket? No. Well - this is most embarrassing.
1046114	No doubt it leads to the place where they are holding my young wizard captive.
1046113	In their haste to escape, one of the abductors dropped a marked recall rune.
1046112	I must ask you to go after the evil undead that abducted my apprentice and return him to safety.
1078804	Playguide/Skills: Tactics<BR>http://www.uoherald.com/guide/skill_27.php
1046111	No doubt the mysterious dark force is behind the abduction of my most valuable student.
1046110	’Tis a bad omen, as this was one of the few apprentices who knew of my new spell formulas.
1046109	As I am sure Uzeraan has told you, one of my apprentices was abducted.
1046108	Thank the heavens! Uzeraan said he would send someone, but I did not expect you so soon.
1046107	The Archmage's face lights up as he spots you in the doorway.
1046106	You have found Aegis!
1046105	Good luck, young mage. I hope you succeed. May the aethers have mercy upon us if you do not.
1046104	If you have any trouble finding it, ask other adventurers around you and I am sure someone will aid you.
1046103	Aegis runs a reagent shop west of the teleporter park within the Moonglow city walls.
1046102	Upon your arrival, follow the path North and you will find Moonglow.
1046101	Excellent. You have returned.  I will transport you to Moonglow now.
1046100	Go and gather any supplies you may need for your journey. Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.
1046099	You, dear friend, have proven yourself worthy of such a quest.  I have sent word to Aegis that I will send you to aid him.
1046098	We must send someone to find the apprentice and free him before he is slain! Time is limited!
1046097	I have just received word from Aegis that one of his most trusted students was taken!
1046096	Apparently, many of Aegis' apprentices have been getting abducted in an attempt to force information from them.
1046095	The new spell would easily swing the tides in our favor in the battle against this unknown evil that has befallen us.
1046094	My friend and associate, Aegis The Archmage of Moonglow, has been secretly working on a new spell formula.
1046093	The issue of the restless souls requires more investigation, but alas, a more pressing matter has surfaced.
1046092	I have placed some reagents, a few scrolls and some gold in your pack.
1046091	The villagers wanted me to thank you for your help and have given me some items to reward you with.
1046090	It seems the caves are lost to us as the restless souls you describe have made it their new home.
1046089	Uzeraan looks very disturbed at your report.  After a long silence he speaks to you:
1046088	Mission Complete.  You have slain the restless souls as instructed. Return to Uzeraan to report.
1046087	Remember that there is a teleporter somewhere in the cave that will lead back to the surface.
1046086	Slay 6 of the creatures and gather any information on their weaknesses that you can.
1046085	Go now into the caves below and find out what you can about the creatures coming from there.
1046084	I was beginning to think you would not return. I am glad to see that I was mistaken.
1046083	Go and gather any other supplies you think you will need and then return here. I will transport you below upon your return.
1046082	On second thought, *YOU* would do much better against the wretched wraiths than any of our soldiers.
1046081	Now I can send the few remaining soldiers in to the cave to investigate the state of affairs.
1046080	Just a few Mark and Recall scrolls for you to try out. I've also given you some blank recall runes.
1078771	#NAME?
1046079	Thank you stranger. You are not a moment too soon. For your help I have placed a few scrolls in your pack to aid you.
1046078	Uzeraan nods at you with approval and begins to speak:
1046077	Please hurry - time is short and so is our supply of fighters to fend off the wicked creatures.
1046076	I have no money for reagents to give you at this time, but be assured that I will repay you.
1046075	I must ask of you to go and gather Mandrake Root for me.  Try the reagent shops if you have money, or find another way if you do not.
1046074	My supply of Mandrake Root has run dry and so I cannot cast any of the magic travel spells needed to enter the cave.
1046073	Unfortunately, to cast any spell, one must have the necessary reagents. Reagents that I do not have.
1046072	This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.
1046071	Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.
1046070	Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.
1046069	Gate Travel allows you to open a magical gate to the location of your marked recall rune. This way, others can travel with you.
1046068	There is also another, called 'Gate Travel' which operates on the same principles as the Recall spell.
1046067	Simply cast the Recall spell and target the marked recall rune of the location you wish to travel to.
1046066	This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.
1046065	To instantly return to the location where the rune was marked, you employ the 'Recall' spell.
1046064	You then cast the Mark spell and target the recall rune. This inscribes the rune with the location at which you are standing.
1046063	Then, you need either in your spellbook, or inscribed on a scroll a 'Mark' spell. 'Tis a spell of the 6th circle.
1046062	To begin with, you need what is called a recall rune.  Blank recall runes can be purchased at most any magic supply shop.
1046061	MAGIC TRAVEL:
1046060	Well - there is one way. Let me tell you something of magic travel...
1046059	The horrid phantasms still haunt us on a nightly basis using MY teleporter to get here. We have no way to get into the cave!
1046058	What's worse is that this teleporter only goes one way: Out of the cave, into our village.
1046057	The villagers did not know that I had recently installed a teleporter in the cave.  It was designed to give the workers a quick way to return home from the cave.
1046056	In their folly, a mob of frightened villagers collapsed the entrance to the mining cave.
1046055	It seems horrible creatures have been emerging from the caves at night, terrorizing the villagers.
1046054	Unfortunately, I have more disturbing news. We once had an underground cavern that we used for mining ore.
1046053	For your efforts I have placed a small token of my appreciation in your backpack.
1046052	You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Shadow Wisps'. I am pleased.
1046051	You bring sad news stranger and I fear our men may be lost forever. They will be mourned.
1046050	Uzeraan gives you a somber look and begins to speak slowly:
1046049	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.
1046048	Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.  He is no doubt eagerly awaiting your return.
1078738	   Mana, the powerful substance used in casting spells from scrolls or spellbooks, as well as in the practice of inscription, is as rich as gold to any who use its power on a daily basis. The Meditation skill allows spellcasters and others to increase the rate at which they regenerate Mana.
1046047	Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Shadow Wisps'.
1046046	Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.

1046043	I know we have just met, but our need is dire and I must ask of you a favor.

1078563	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Good day, friend. I am Amser, leader of New Haven.<BR>As you can see, many things have changed in this city. Much of the island has sunken beneath the waves, and the old city lies ruined to the southeast. The refugees have told us of the great destruction that engulfed their homes, and all we can do is offer them shelter.<BR>You may notice that our village lacks the look of one rebuilt from the ruins. It is true - we, and our very city, are not from this time. The same forces that destroyed the island seem to have altered our own fates as well.<BR>We have been advised to not speak much of these things, at great peril, for we must preserve the past to ensure our future.<BR>Now then, please, our city is at your disposal. If you seek friends from the old city, you might wish to visit the inns or the infirmary. May the Virtues guide your path.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

1078262	Well, this is where we must part ways. There are more newcomers for me to assist, and I must return to the docks to help them.<br><br>On the map, I have marked the location of the person who will guide you through your continued training.<br><br>Farewell, friend. May all your adventures be great.
1078261	This gate will lead you out of here, and on the road to New Haven. It's a town of learning, a place where you will get trained and learn how to advance in all of the skills vital to your prosperity in the world of Sosaria.<br><br>Follow the path to the West.
1078260	Uh oh. It's the Dark Knight. I don't see a way to slip past him.<br><br>So, it looks like you're going to have to talk to him.<br><br>Double Left click on the Dark Knight to speak with him, and let's hope he's in a good mood.
1078259	Good job! You have retrieved your items. Take a look in your backpack and re-equip your weapon. You will also find a small gift from me.<br><br>The Token of Passage will allow you to get through a gate protected by an energy field. I have marked the gate on your map.<br><br>Head to the gate and pass through the energy field.
1078258	Good! You are back among the living.<br><br>Once you are resurrected you will have only 15 minutes to return to your body and collect your equipment from your corpse. Your corpse location is now marked on the map.<br><br>Double Left click on your corpse to retrieve your items.
1078257	Oh No! They got you.<br><br>Death in the world of Sosaria is not a trivial thing, but neither is it the end of your adventures.<br><br>You now exist in a ghostly state, and cannot interact with the world of the living.<br><br>The location of the nearest Healer appears on your map. Go to the location marked Resurrection on your map.
1078256	Alright, the zombies beyond this gate are tough, but you have proven to be pretty good with a weapon thus far.<br><br>Head through the gate and take one of those zombies out.<br><br>When you have a zombie targeted, Left click on the Magic Arrow scroll icon in the hotbar to cast the spell.
1078255	Don't use that scroll yet. You will need it against your next opponent.<br><br>Let's head to the next waypoint on your map. Head Northwest, then North, and follow path to the East.<br><br>I'm waiting for you to approach the next gate.
1078254	Very good!<br><br>You should have a scroll of Magic Arrow in your backpack.<br><br>Scrolls, and other items, like the healing potion or bandages, can be put into your hotbar on the bottom left of your screen. <br><br>Drag the scroll of Magic Arrow from your inventory to an open slot on the hotbar.
1078253	Well done! When you have taken any damage, it's a good idea to heal up before going into battle again.<br><br>You have a Potion of Healing in your inventory. To drink the potion, Double Left click on it and you will drink it.<br><br>Even if you are not injured, try and drink the potion now.
1078252	This is what the poor thing was carrying, remnants of its life long past. It's sad, really.<br><br>Anyway, drag all of these items to your inventory. You can right click on each item to loot as well.
1078251	You destroyed the skeleton! Nice work!<br><br>Now you can check it to see if it was carrying anything of value.<br><br>Double Left click on its corpse.
1078250	Looks like you found a suitable target.<br><br>Let's slay the wretched beast.<br><br>Double left click on the skeleton, and move within reach.<br><br>Once you begin attacking, you will continue to do so until the creature is dead.
1078249	Great, now you are in an aggressive stance. Perfect for fighting.<br><br>Now remember to toggle back into Peace mode before you try to interact with friendly townsfolk. They don't usually take kindly to being attacked.<br><br>Left click on the Next button to continue.
1078248	This is the town of Old Haven, or what remains of it. The former residents have been reanimated from the dead.<br><br>Your first challenge is to return just one of these skeletons to the grave.<br><br>Left click on the War/Peace button on the bar at the bottom left of your screen.
1078247	You'll notice a little marker on the map. That's a waypoint. This waypoint shows you where a gate is.<br><br>Follow the alley towards the marker, and head through the gate.<br><br>Once you arrive at the gate, Double Left click on it.
1078246	Alright, looks like you're ready to go.<br><br>Before you can start your adventures, you'll have to complete a few challenges.<br><br>Open your map at the bottom of the screen.

I hope these serve you well. Farewell, friend.
1078220	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Ranger (for Tracking). Return to Walker in New Haven to claim your reward.
1078219	So far so good, kid. You are still alive, and you are getting the hang of Tracking. There are many more animals, monsters, and people to track. Come back to me once you have tracked them.
1078218	Farewell, friend. Be careful out here. If you change your mind and want to learn Tracking, come back and talk to me.
1078217	Track animals, monsters, and people on Haven Island until you have raised your Tracking skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hello friend. I am Walker, Grandmaster Ranger. An adventurer needs to keep alive in the wilderness. Being able to track those around you is essential to surviving in dangerous places. Certain Ninja abilities are more potent when the Ninja possesses Tracking knowledge.

1078015	The Dragon's Tail
1078014	You have proven yourself young one. You will continue to improve as your skills are honed with age. You are an honorable warrior, worthy of the rank of Apprentice Samurai.  Please accept this no-dachi as a gift. It is called "The Dragon's Tail". Upon a successful strike in combat, there is a chance this mighty weapon will replenish your stamina equal to the damage of your attack. I hope "The Dragon's Tail" serves you well. You have earned it. Farewell for now.
1078013	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Samurai. Return to Hamato in New Haven to report your progress.
1078012	You are not ready to become an Apprentice Samurai. There are still more undead to lay to rest. Return to me once you have done so.
1078011	Good journey to you. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Samurai.
1078010	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. use the Confidence defensive stance and attempt to honorably execute monsters there until you have raised your Bushido skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings. I see you wish to learn the Way of the Samurai. Wielding a blade is easy. Anyone can grasp a sword's hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman. Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here.<br><br>Adventure East to Old Haven. Use the Confidence defensive stance and attempt to honorably execute the undead that inhabit there. You will need a book of Bushido to perform these abilities. If you do not possess a book of Bushido, you can purchase one from me. <br><br>If you fail to honorably execute the undead, your defenses will be greatly weakened: Resistances will suffer and Resisting Spells will suffer. A successful parry instantly ends the weakness. If you succeed, however, you will be infused with strength and healing. Your swing speed will also be boosted for a short duration. With practice, you will learn how to master your Bushido abilities.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you have become an Apprentice Samurai.
1078009	You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Samurai. Your Bushido potential is not enhanced here.
1078008	Your Bushido potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.
1078007	The Way of the Samurai
1078006	Greetings! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Samurai profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>Hamato teaches Bushido. I suggest talking to him first. Bushido is the way of life for a Samurai. A Samurai can honorably execute his enemies or even evade powerful attacks such as dragon's breath or lightning bolts.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<br><br>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Samurai in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent's strength and dexterity.<br><br>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a Samurai, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt; sometimes badly. Knowing how to heal yourself and your allies is an invaluable skill for any Samurai.<br><br>Tyl Ariadne teaches Parrying. The more skilled you are at deflecting your opponent's blows, the longer you'll last in battle.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<br><br>Hamato is located at the School of Bushido. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<br><br>Always remember...<br><br>A man who is a warrior by trade should calm his mind and look into the depths of others. Doing so is the way to becoming a legendary Samurai and the way to true Enlightenment.
1078005	The Code of Bushido
1078004	You are already holding something.
1078003	A Loose Floorboard
1078002	Your backpack is full, so the tear drops to the ground!
1078001	You have sacrificed enough already.
1078000	Meditate again to sacrifice 30 of your highest stat. WARNING!
1077999	As you make your sacrifice, Sudiva sheds a tear. You pick it up and place it into your backpack.
1077998	You may not sacrifice stats while under the influence of stat altering effects.
1077997	Sudiva is no longer paying attention to you.
1077996	Sudiva looks at you as if she is waiting for you to do something.
1077995	As Sudiva turns and stares at you, you wisely decide not to get any closer.
1077994	It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
1077993	The darkness is impenetrable! Entering the cavern will not be easy...
1077992	The Candle of Love roars to life, dispelling the darkness surrounding you. You are suddenly overcome with joy and begin to cry.
1077991	The Candle of Love sparks to life for a moment as it absorbs your flame, making you feel very hopeful for the future.
1077990	The Candle of Love absorbs your flame and glows slightly, leaving you with a sense of wellbeing.
1077989	The Candle of Love absorbs your flame and you feel content with yourself.
1077988	The Candle of Love quickly absorbs your flame.
1077987	You stare into the Candle of Love.
1077986	As you touch your Purified Candle to the Candle of Love, you feel Astaroth's hold on this cavern diminish slightly. You've done your part to uphold the Principle of Love, now it up to your fellow Britannians to do theirs.
1077985	There is not much time left, please hurry!
1077984	You've failed to bring the Purified Candle to the Candle of Love. Return to Anne, the Keeper of the Flame, to obtain another.
1077983	You simply cannot walk away now! Please, I beg of thee, do not!
1077982	The Candle of Love
1077981	Only one last task remains for you to help oppose Astaroth's growing power. Take the purified candle I just gave you, enter the Candle of Love Cavern below us, and touch your flame to the Candle of Love.<br><br>This isn't quite as simple as it sounds, as you'll need to do two things. First, remember to hold the purified candle in your hand to cross the area of darkness. Once you've done that, you will encounter a puzzle to solve that helps to protect the Candle of Love. Solve this puzzle, and touch your flame to the candle quickly, as you won't have much time once you've crossed the lava.<br><br>Before you go, I wish to thank you for all that you have done. Hurry now, for Astaroth will not wait.
1077980	As you finish walking the path shown to you, you will be given sigils for each of the three virtues.<br><br>Bring me the Heart of Compassion, the Quill of Justice and the Tear of Sacrifice, along with a regular candle. In return, I will provide you with what you need to enter the cavern below.
1077979	Here, take this purified candle.<br><br>You have but one task remaining...
1077978	Talk to Anne to have her purify your candle!
1077977	I need the Heart of Compassion, the Quill of Justice and the Tear of Sacrifice plus a regular candle.
1077976	*Anne blinks*<br><br>How can you possibly say no? Don't you know how important it is to defeat Astaroth?
1077975	A Purified Candle

1077973	A Loose Floor Board
1077972	The Virtues
1077971	Make room in your backpack first!
1077970	You grab the Prisoner's Journal and put it in your backpack.
1077969	You really shouldn't open strange chests...
1077968	Executioner's Chest
1077967	Well done! I hope that the Executioner didn't give you too much trouble.<br><br>As promised, here is the pen he used to sign writs of death.
1077966	You have slain the Executioner! Return to Andrew as soon as you can.
1077965	You'll find the Executioner in Dungeon Wrong. Hurry!
1077964	Oh, I am very disappointed. How can you come this far to deny the Executioner the Justice that he so deserves?
1077963	A Rusty Pen
1077962	The executioner still roams free in Dungeon Wrong after all these years. Go there, slay him, then return to me. By then, I will have found the pen that he used to sign the writ of execution for Thomas. Be careful, for he surrounds himself with many terrible creatures!
1077961	Executioner's Last Stand

1077952	Well met!
1077951	You are already under the effect of an accelerated skillgain scroll.
1077950	You place Sudiva's Tear on the shrine and begin to meditate on the Virtue of Sacrifice. You find yourself sympathizing with Sudiva's plight. Although the great dragon played no small role in bringing her own self to her current condition, your feel that no living being should be made to suffer so, regardless of how it happened.<br><br>Your sacrifice has begun her healing process; hopefully someday she will be free from Astaroth's grip and can fly once against amongst the clouds.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that Sudiva's Tear has transformed into a Tear of Sacrifice. You quickly put it into your backpack, and prepare yourself to continue along your journey.

1077944	The feeling of covetous washes over you once again, compelling you to seek out its source.
1077943	A True Sacrifice
1077942	As you meditate on the virtue of Sacrifice, you envision a dark, watery cavern. As your mind wanders through the cave, you realize that there is treasure piled high against the wall. As you focus on the piles of gold and gems, a feeling of unbridled covetous washes over you with such force that your mind recoils away from the treasure.<br><br>It is at that moment that you realize you are being watched, as you spot a dark form moving amongst the shadows; its eyes watching, ever-vigilant, over the hoard.<br><br>You know you must find the source of this overwhelming greed if you are to continue down this path.
1077941	Heart of Compassion
1077940	Clearing Thomas' name!
1077939	Prisoner's Journal
1077938	'Tis my journal! It's strange to see it after all these years.<br><br>All that's left to do is to take it to someone that can change the official record. Perhaps someone at a court?<br><br>Maybe I can finally rest in peace!
1077937	A Journal Delivery
1077936	Is that it? Hold it up here so I can read it and make sure it's my journal.
1077935	You've found the journal! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost with it.
1077934	I'm pretty sure that the journal can be found deeper inside the dungeon.
1077933	Thomas' Story
1077932	This skeleton is awfully dusty!
1077931	OOoooOOOOOooOOOooOOOOOooO
1077930	OooooOOOOoooOOOooO... oh, wait, you can actually hear me.
1077929	What's this? Why, yes, I do remember this case. It was quite a few years ago, but something seemed fishy about it back then and I've thought about the boy and his betrothed off and on since then.<br><br>*Andy reads the journal entry*<br><br>By the Virtues! I knew Thomas was innocent! Thank you so much for bringing this to me, I will make sure that the official record is changed as soon as possible. It won't undo the injustice done to Thomas, but it's the least we can do. Though, perhaps there is something more to be done...
1077928	Why are you standing around here talking to a ghost? Get moving!
1077927	You've failed to deliver the journal to someone who can clear Thomas' name! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost.
1077926	Well, it's certainly up to you, but it would be nice for Thomas' name to be cleared after all this time...
1077925	That skeleton you’re poking at has a history, you know. ‘Tis all that is left of a boy that went by the name of Thomas. He was convicted for murder! A great injustice the whole farce turned out to be. I wrote his true story down in a journal, but the executioner found it. Even though I only had a few years left to serve, he had me executed on the spot.<br><br>I bet if you found my journal, you could clear Thomas’ name! Unfortunately, I don’t know where the executioner kept his things. Perhaps deeper in this prison?
1077924	You place the rusty pen on the shrine and begin to meditate.<br><br>The injustice done to both Nina and Thomas stirs a feeling of great sadness inside of you. Though the record has finally been set straight after all these years, you can't help but to think that after all the executioner had done he deserved a far worse punishment than death.<br><br>You vow to meditate more on the Virtue of Justice in your future travels so that you might better understand how to temper your feelings with Love.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the pen has been transformed by Justice! Stepping up to the shrine, you take the Pen of Justice, as your intuition tells you that you'll need it eventually on your quest to thwart Astaroth.
1077923	Once again, the image of a skeleton shackled to a wall leaps to the forefront of your mind.
1077922	As you meditate on the virtue of Justice, you find yourself envisioning a dusty skeleton, shackled to a wall. As you ponder the skeleton's existence, a feeling a great injustice washes over you suddenly.<br><br>As you step back from the shrine and open your eyes, the feeling subsides, leaving you with the strong desire to right this great wrong, whatever it may be.

1077899	...of Astaroth laughing, all too pleased with his handiwork. 
1077898	The image finally fades, but not before you catch a glimpse...
1077897	...despise. You tremble at the horrible image before you.
1077896	...blackened, twisted and utterly consumed by...
1077895	As the image dissolves, you are shown a large heart...
1077894	...seeking revenge against all of humanity.
1077893	...so that he might spend the rest of his days...
1077892	...and become the biggest and strongest ogre of them all...
1077891	You somehow hear him vow in his heart to grow up...
1077890	Tears silently stream down the young ogre's face.
1077889	...as slowly and gruesomely as possible.
1077888	They are taking great pleasure in killing the ogre's family...
1077887	A party of rage driven humans is torturing his family.
1077886	The ogre is watching a horrifying scene unfold before him.
1077885	You see a very young ogre hiding at the back of his cave.
1077884	As you peer into the crystal ball, an image begins to form.
1077883	You recognize the crystal ball as the one from your vision.
1077882	A Heart Blackened by Despise
1077881	You place the blackened heart on the Shrine of Compassion and begin to meditate. Sadness overcomes you as you think about the fate of the ogre. Astaroth's influence in the ogre's life corrupted his heart to the extent that he was so consumed by despise of the human race that his capability to feel content with his life, much less to find true happiness, was completely taken away from him.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the ogre's corrupted heart has been purified by Compassion. You pick up the Heart of Compassion, as you have a feeling that you'll need it later if you hope to do your part in battling Astaroth's plan.
1077880	The vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal returns to your mind.
1077879	You've strayed too far from the path of Compassion. Return to the Shrine of Compassion and meditate some more.
1077878	You suddenly feel quite ashamed of yourself.
1077877	As you meditate on the virtue of Compassion, you start to feel utter despise towards the human race. The feeling burns intensely in your heart, filling you with blind rage and a compulsion to maim and torture any human that dare enter your home.<br><br>As the feeling begins to fade, you see a vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal, and you somehow know that your path lies in that direction.
1077876	A Compassionate Task
1077875	You feel as if the shrine preferred that you do something else.

Just keep in mind that if you're tinkering just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.  <br><br>Come here, my brand new Apprentice Tinker, I want to give you something special. I created this just for you, so I hope you like it. It's a set of Tinker's Tools that contains a bit of magic. These tools have more charges than any Tinker's Tools a Tinker can make. You can even use them to make a normal set of tools, so that way you won't ever find yourself stuck somewhere with no tools!

1077657	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Warrior profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will probably want to talk to him first since knowing how to handle a weapon is the first step on the path to mastering the art of surviving on the path to becoming a warrior. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon doesn’t really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a warrior, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt; sometimes badly. Knowing how to heal yourself and your allies is an invaluable skill for any warrior.<BR><BR>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a warrior in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent's strength and dexterity.<BR><BR>Sarsmea Smythe teaches Focus. The ability to balance yourself physically and mentally can help a warrior stay fresh both in body and spirit.<BR><BR>Tyl Ariadne teaches Parrying. The more skilled you are at deflecting your opponent's blows, the longer you'll last in battle.<BR><BR>May your sword stay sharp, your mace heavy and your kryss, um...pointy!
1077656	The Warrior's Path
1077655	Well, well. Another youngling. You are here to prove your mettle. I think you have none. But there is some persistence in you. You may learn to master that weapon someday.<br><br>When you get some training under your belt and feel you have mastered your arts, come find me, so I can eliminate those who seek to keep this world from dark clutches.<br><br>Take this Rune. When you feel you have mastered your skills, come and find me. I will be waiting.
1077654	You will use this same method to put on weapons, armor, and clothing. The slot has to be clear of any other items. So if you are wearing a hat, and want to put on a helmet, you will have to take off the hat, first.<br><br>Left click the Next button to continue.
1077653	Great! The Keeper has given you a weapon. You need to equip it.<br><br>Left click on the Paperdoll icon on the lower right of your screen.<br><br>Drag the Worn Katana from your backpack to your hand slot in the Paperdoll.
1077652	You found the Worn Katana. You need to toggle it as a quest item.<br><br>Hold down the Shift key, Right click on yourself, and select 'Toggle Quest Item' from the context menu. A 'Targeting Cursor' will appear.<br><br>Left click on the Worn Katana, press the Esc key, and then talk to Hogarth.
1077651	Great! You are on your first quest.<br><br>It's a small one, but I'm sure you will be rewarded nonetheless.<br><br>Remember to pick up the Worn Katana and then talk to the Keeper to complete the quest.
1077650	To speak with the Keeper, Double Left click on him.<br><br>Please read the quest text and accept the quest to proceed.
1077649	Excellent!<br><br>Now approach Hogarth the Keeper of Old Haven in the building to the East of you. He is the Keeper of Old Haven, and he has a task for you.<br><br>A glowing light toward the East marks his location.
1077648	To pick up an object, Left click and drag it into your backpack window.<br><br>There are other goodies in the crates and barrels, go ahead and grab some for yourself.
1077647	This is where you will carry items.<br><br>Up ahead are some crates. There are supplies in them you may need.<br><br>To open the crates, mouse over them until you see their item properties.<br><br>Double Left click on it to see what's inside.
1077646	Alright! Now you have your footing.<br><br>Many things you find in the world, you will be able to pick up and carry.<br><br>You have been given a backpack to carry all your belongings in.<br><br>Left click on the Backpack Icon in the lower right corner of your screen.
1077645	Good!<br><br>Do you see the glowing light?<br><br>Right click and hold over it to run in that direction.
1077644	Very good!<br><br>Right click and hold, further away, to run to the glowing light.
1077643	Movement is controlled with the mouse.<br><br>Do you see the glowing light?<br><br>Right click and hold over it to walk in that direction.
1077642	Greetings, Traveler! Welcome to the world of Ultima Online.<br><br>I am Gwen. I am here to help you learn the basic skills needed to thrive in your travels to come.<br><br>Left click on the Next button to continue.
1077641	Try that there katana. The long, metal one with the sharp edge on it.
1077640	Here ya go. It looks plenty strong enough ta me.<br><br>Oh and best work on keeping yer eyes open. I slipped it back into yer bag when you wasn't lookin' Haha!
1077639	That's it! A good soldier learns ta follow orders. Bring it ta me fer yer reward.
1077638	Well then, ya ain't gettin' through that gate until you bring me that katana.
1077637	Pick up the Worn Katana and talk to the Keeper to complete the quest.<br><center>------</center><br>So they send ya ta me to get ya outfitted. Well then, ya need to get a weapon. I would recommend the katana, as there's nothing better than three feet of steel to make anything think twice 'bout attackin' ya.<br><br>Tell ya what. Get me that katana. It's over there on the table. I need to look at it to be sure it's fit to skewer the unnaturals up ahead.
1077636	Three Feet of Steel
1077635	Pursuits of the Arcane
1077634	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Mage profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Kaelynna teaches Magery. I suggest seeking her out first. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle.<BR><BR>Gustar teaches Meditation. This skill allows someone to regenerate mana at an accelerated rate.<BR><BR>Mithneral teaches Evaluating Intelligence. This skill greatly enhances offensive Magery spells. Evaluating Intelligence also allows mages to 'size up' the mental capabilities of an opponent.<BR><BR>Dimethro teaches Wrestling. This skill enhances defense capabilities while in combat. Opponents will have a harder time landing blows against mages while they are spell casting.<BR><BR>Jillian teaches Inscription. This skill allows scribes to create scrolls that can be added to spellbooks. Inscription also slightly enhances a mage's offensive spells.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Resisting Spells which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Dimethro is located near the entrance to the New Haven dueling pits. The other instructors are located throughout the New Haven Mage School.<BR><BR>May your spells never fail you!
1077633	Happy Valentine's Day! To get your gift, please remove some items from your backpack or bank and log back in.
1077632	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077631	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Scribe. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077630	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Wrestler. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Wrestler and I will reward you with something useful.
1077629	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Scholar. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scholar and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077628	You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Stoic and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077627	Bracelet of Resilience
1077626	You have successfully begun your journey in becoming a true master of Magery. On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this bracelet. When worn, the Bracelet of Resilience will enhance your resistances vs. the elements, physical, and poison harm. The Bracelet of Resilience also magically enhances your ability fend off ranged and melee attacks. I hope it serves you well.
1077625	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage (for Resisting Spells). Return to Alefian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077624	The ability to resist powerful spells is a taxing experience. I understand your resistance in wanting to pursue it. If you wish to reconsider, feel free to return to me for Resisting Spells training. Good journey to you!
1077623	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Battle spell casting monsters there until you have raised your Resisting Spells skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met! To become a true master of the arcane art of Magery, I suggest learning the complementary skill known as Resisting Spells. While the name of this skill may suggest that it helps with resisting all spells, this is not the case. This skill helps you lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time. It does not lessen damage from spells such as Energy Bolt or Flamestrike.<BR><BR>The Magery spells that can be resisted are Clumsy, Curse, Feeblemind, Mana Drain, Mana Vampire, Paralyze, Paralyze Field, Poison, Poison Field, and Weaken.<BR><BR>The Necromancy spells that can be resisted are Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Mind Rot, and Pain Spike.<BR><BR>At higher ranks, the Resisting Spells skill also benefits you by adding a bonus to your minimum elemental resists. This bonus is only applied after all other resist modifications - such as from equipment - has been calculated. It's also not cumulative. It compares the number of your minimum resists to the calculated value of your modifications and uses the higher of the two values.<BR><BR>As you can see, Resisting Spells is a difficult skill to understand, and even more difficult to master. This is because in order to improve it, you will have to put yourself in harm's way - as in the path of one of the above spells.<BR><BR>Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven. We need your assistance in cleansing the town of this evil influence. Old Haven is located east of here. Battle the undead spell casters that inhabit there.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.

1077620	Hallowed Spellbook
1077619	Scribing is a very fulfilling pursuit. I am pleased to see you embark on this journey. You sling a pen well! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this spellbook. When equipped, the Hallowed Spellbook greatly enhances the potency of your offensive spells when used against Undead. Be mindful, though. While this book is equipped, when you invoke your powerful spells and abilities vs. Humanoids such as other humans, orcs, ettins, trolls, and the like, your offensive spells will diminish in effectiveness. I suggest unequipping the Hallowed Spellbook when battling Humanoids. I hope this spellbook serves you well.
1077618	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Scribe. Return to Jillian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077617	I understand. When you are ready, feel free to return to me for Inscription training. Thanks for stopping by!
1077616	While here at the New Haven Magery Library, use a scribe's pen and scribe and 3rd and 4th circle Magery scrolls that you have in your spellbook. Remember, you will need blank scrolls as well. Do this until you have raised your Inscription skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings and welcome to the New Haven Magery Library! You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed in a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription may transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls.<BR><BR>Before you inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. It may sound easy, but there is a bit more to it. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of Inscription is mana. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. When inscribing 3rd circle or lower spells this will not be much of a problem for these spells consume a small amount of mana. However, when you are inscribing higher circle spells, you may see your mana drain rapidly. When this happens, pause or meditate before continuing.<BR><BR>I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.

1077614	Gloves of Safeguarding
1077613	It's about time! Looks like you managed to make it through your self-defense training. As I promised, here's a little something for you. When worn, these Gloves of Safeguarding will increase your awareness and resistances to most everything expect poison. Oh yeah, they also increase your natural health regeneration as well. Pretty handy gloves, indeed.<BR><BR>Oh, if you are wondering if your meditating will be hindered while wearing these gloves, it won't be. Mages can wear cloth and leather items without needing to worry about that.<BR><BR>Now get out of here and make something of yourself!
1077612	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Wrestler. Return to Dimethro in New Haven to receive your prize.
1077611	Ok, featherweight. Come back to me if you want learn the rudiments of self-defense.
1077610	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there until you have raised your Wrestling skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Listen up! If you want to learn the rudiments of self-defense, you need toughen up, and there's no better way to toughen up than engaging in combat. Head East out of town to Old Haven and battle the undead there in hand to hand combat. Afraid of dying, you say? Well, you should be! Being an adventurer isn't a bed of posies, or roses, or however that saying goes. If you do take a dirt nap, go to one of the nearby wandering healers and they'll get you back on your feet.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Wrestler and I will reward you with a prize.
1077609	The Rudiments of Self Defense
1077608	Ring of the Savant
1077607	You have completed the task. Well done. On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this ring. When worn, the Ring of the Savant enhances your intellectual aptitude and increases your mana pool. Your spell casting abilities will take less time to invoke and recovering from such spell casting will be hastened. I hope the Ring of the Savant serves you well.
1077606	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Scholar. Return to Mithneral in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077605	Return to me if you reconsider and wish to become an Apprentice Scholar.
1077604	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use Evaluating Intelligence on all creatures you see there. You can also cast Magery spells as well to raise Evaluating Intelligence. Do these activities until you have raised your Evaluating Intelligence skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hello. Truly knowing your opponent is essential for landing your offensive spells with precision. I can teach you how to enhance the effectiveness of your offensive spells, but first you must learn how to size up your opponents intellectually. I have a scholarly task for you. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use Evaluating Intelligence on all creatures you see there. You can also cast Magery spells as well to raise Evaluating Intelligence.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scholar and I will reward you with an arcane prize.
1077603	A Scholarly Task
1077602	Philosopher's Hat
1077601	Splendid! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this hat. When worn, the Philosopher's Hat will protect you somewhat from physical attacks. The Philosopher's Hat also enhances the potency of your offensive spells, lowers the mana cost of your arcane spells and abilities, and passively increases your mana regeneration rate. Ah yes, I almost forgot. The Philosopher's Hat also grants one other special ability to its wearer. It allows a chance for the wearer to cast spells without using any reagents. I hope the Philosopher's Hat serves you well.
1077600	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic (for Meditation). Return to Gustar in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.
1077599	Seek me out if you ever wish to study the art of Meditation. Good journey.
1077598	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and meditate there until you have raised your Meditation skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well met! I can teach you how to 'Stop the World' around you and focus your inner energies on replenishing your mana. What is mana? Mana is the life force for everyone who practices arcane arts. When a practitioner of magic invokes a spell or scribes a scroll, it consumes mana. Having an abundant supply of mana is vital to excelling as a practitioner of the arcane. Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stoics. The Meditation skill allows stoics to increase the rate at which they regenerate mana.<BR><BR>A stoic needs to perform abilities or cast spells to deplete mana before he can meditate to replenish it. Meditation can occur passively or actively. Actively Meditation is more difficult to master but allows for the stoic to replenish mana at a significantly faster rate. Metal armor interferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating.<BR><BR>Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and actively meditate to replenish it.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Stoic and I will reward you with an arcane prize.

1077582	Ember Staff
1077581	Well done! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this staff. Normally a mage must unequip weapons before spell casting. While wielding your new Ember Staff, however, you will be able to invoke your Magery spells.<BR><BR>Even if you do not currently possess skill in Mace Fighting, the Ember Staff will allow you to fight as if you do. However, your Magery skill will be temporarily reduced while doing so.<BR><BR>Finally, the Ember Staff occasionally smites a foe with a Fireball while wielding it in melee combat. I hope the Ember Staff serves you well.

1077578	Very well, come back to me when you are ready to practice Magery. You have so much arcane potential. 'Tis a shame to see it go to waste. The New Haven Mage Council could really use your help.
1077577	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Cast fireballs and lightning bolts against monsters there until you have raised your Magery skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings.

1077446	Please help us find the real Book of Truth! Awful dark entities from beyond our world have stolen it, made fake copies and spread them all over the dungeons. Bring me 10 of these books, and I'll give you a rare music box gear that has been in my family for generations. Won't you please help us find the real Book of Truth?
1077445	Thank you for responding to our call for help. As you know, dark entities from beyond our world have stolen the Book of Truth. To keep us from finding the book, they have created thousands of false books, which are carried by the denizens of dungeons Covetous, Deceit, Despise, Destard, Hythloth, Shame and Wrong. Return 25 of these copies to me, and I shall reward you with a sword unlike any other in the lands. 
1077444	Veracity's Treasure Box
1077443	The Book of Truth has been stolen! 'Tis said that the dark entities from beyond our world are behind this evil deed, and to keep us from finding it, they've made lots of copies. My twin sister and I have made a pledge to help return the book to safety, but I'm afraid that we wouldn't be very useful in the dungeons. We're going to help Mistress Menzzobaanea examine any of the copies that you can bring us, and I promise to give you a small reward for each one that you bring to me.

1077427	*frowns* I understand. It is a perilous task. Please come back to me if you change your mind. We could really use your help.
1077426	The Book of Truth has been stolen, and we need your help recovering it. I must warn you. Dark entities from beyond our world have replicated it. Monsters in the dungeons guard the books, and only one of the books is the real Book of Truth. If you can find 50 of these books, we can inspect each one and hopefully one of them will be the real Book of Truth. We must recover the Book of Truth so we can stop the dark entities from destroying this reality. Find 50 of these books, and we will reward you with a virtuous prize.

1076523	I'm getting a little sleepy... good night!
1076522	Dinnertime!
1076521	I'm off for Lunch!
1076520	It's breakfast time!
1076519	Sorry! I have to be going
1076518	Oh! Excuse me, I must be going
1076517	Perhaps the barrier canst be breached?
1076516	Nystul once spoke of a barrier surrounding our shard, as though it blocked outside interferences
1076515	Yes, yet, save that night in Lord British's chambers, I hath not seen him. Perhaps he is somehow limited?
1076514	After the Gem was shattered, each shard kept a likeness of the world within it. Such was its power!
1076513	Our world is not alone, for there are thousands upon thousands reflections of the original Britannia
1076512	He seemeth to be an entity from beyond our own dimension, tasked with watching the multiverse
1076511	No ill fate awaits our world now should the people embrace the virtues. Yet, they do not!
1076510	I pray the protections that shield our own shard remain strong
1076509	All life that was unique to our world, gone! Erased as though it had never existed?
1076508	Long after Blackthorn's death, though. Oh how such a horrible fate could be visited on such a noble man!
1076507	I... understand the price that would have been paid. Yet they tell me my lord found another way
1076506	Perhaps it is the wrong word? Yet we are not the true Britannia, and for this my lord is gone...
1076505	Thou knowest then, that our world is but a shadow of another Britannia.
1076504	Lord British told me of it, how such an artifact of evil could be created I darest not imagine.
1076503	I know something of the nature of worlds, yet in what kind of place canst one such as the Time Lord dwell?
1076502	The Time Lord's voice penetrated me to the core. Didst he know I was there, that I and Blackthorn both witnessed this?
1076501	I never wish to feel such a thing again!
1076500	T'were not unlike the night sky, yet deeper and more ethereal
1076499	The very air was torn asunder, as though the air had been peeled away. Beyond it lay darkness and stars
1076498	And alone, neither could overturn the other...
1076497	A pawn for a pawn, a knight for a knight, and then the field was left with naught but lonely kings.
1076496	Ne'er have I seen such a grim game as the one played that eve. For every move there was found a counter!
1076495	*Nitters fiblik*
1076494	*Eeeek!*
1076493	*Squeeeeeek!*
1076492	*Squeak, squirk?*
1076491	*Squirk*
1076490	*Squeek*
1076489	*Squeak*
1076488	I... I canst not tell thee of that
1076487	... I'm sorry to see what happened to him
1076486	Aye! I am a mouse!
1076485	I canst not tell thee more, for I am sworn to secrecy
1076484	Oh, for some time I hath been traveling, seeking answers
1076483	Aye! One day I wish to be able to talk to every intelligent race in the world
1076482	Some people think 'tis an odd thing, but I'm even trying to learn new languages!
1076481	I love cheese! Dost thou have any?
1076480	Hehe, I write books, eat cheese, and talk to people
1076479	Oh! You said it right!
1076478	Yes?
1076477	I'm Sherry!
1076476	Lum!
1076475	Om!
1076474	Summ!

1076472	Beh!
1076471	Ra!
1076470	Mu!
1076469	Ahm!
1076468	Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility
1076467	Aye, 'tis represented in this very castle!
1076466	Veramocor!
1076465	Oh! So few know the mantra of the Axiom of Infinity! How wonderful!
1076464	Cor!
1076463	Amo!
1076462	Ver!
1076461	Truth, Love and Courage - from which flow all the Eight Virtues
1076460	Lord British was given the title 'Champion of the White Light,' and drove Mondain from these lands for a great time
1076459	Akalabeth and the Lands of the Lost King became the Lands of Lord British, and the capital of Akalabeth became Britain
1076458	Oh yes, there were once many kingdoms in Sosaria, Lord British himself united several in his early days
1076457	Hast thou read, 'My Story?' It recordeth many a strange thing about our world
1076456	I often wonder what happened to him... so I wrote a book when I found out!
1076455	After the Stranger defeated Mondain, my lord bound together the shattered remnants of our world into one kingdom
1076454	Aye! Rule, Britannia!
1076453	The world which we know was once Sosaria, but now is one kingdom
1076452	He told me he wast named after his birth place, how odd!
1076451	That's a silly way to pronounce it!
1076450	Lord British once drew a map of it, I wonder what happened to it? It had many countries
1076449	Wouldst thou like to hear the story?
1076448	My favorite is about 'Hubert the Lion'
1076447	Yes! My lord read me many a story from a strange and wonderful land called... 'Urth?' I think 'twas.
1076446	After all, who shall read me stories?
1076445	I canst not even comprehend that strange and horrible being
1076444	With the shards of the Gem and... oh, I do carry on don't I?
1076443	May his name be cursed for ever and ever, 'tis his fault that so many troubles were wrought upon my lord
1076442	I hope she rots.
1076441	Our homeland, from which many fled as Minax's armies laid waste to the kingdom...
1076440	This land was brought about by Lord British and Nystul, to stay a horrible evil brought upon us by Minax
1076439	Our proud country's borders extend across the waves! E'en be it Trammel or Felucca, many call it home
1076438	Lord British has been Britannia's ruler since its inception
1076437	Oh, well, 'tis been a hard time for Britannia, yet the Council seemeth able to stay the course
1076436	Now the Council rules in his stead
1076435	I know not where, but I shall wait for him!
1076434	My liege, the sovereign ruler of Britannia, yet he hath gone...
1076433	Oh, there's the throne room, dining hall, kitchen, meeting hall, studio, laboratory, library, and my lord's bedroom
1076432	One of Britannia's finest smithys, I canst not count how many of our guards wear the Order shields forged there
1076431	'Tis behind the castle's southwest wing. There was a time when it bustled with activity!
1076430	I think the most interesting things are the garden, stables, barracks, blacksmithing, training area, or that odd tower
1076429	Well, wouldst thou like to know more about the grounds or the inside?
1076428	'Tis separate from the city's, yet almost as complex!
1076427	Yes, quite a few are intertwined with the castle's sewer, but people are too big to fit!
1076426	Oh yes! The foundations are buried right beneath us! I once explored some of the passages
1076425	This isn't the first castle, of course! 'Tis built upon the remains of older castles as the kingdom grew
1076424	Oh! Would you like to know about the castle? I can tell you about its history or even the layout!
1076423	The Commander gave me a fluffy pillow!
1076422	Aye, there is a council of Lords and Ladies that manage the kingdom in my lord's... absence
1076421	'Tis so big! I used to sit in 'pon many a meeting between Lord British and his Council
1076420	He's nice, but I miss the funny old man!
1076419	I asked Clainin what happened to him... but no one seemeth to have a good answer for me
1076418	Be veryyy careful in there! Nystul used to make things explode all the time! Clainin is no better!
1076417	Many of the land's finest artists come here to paint portraits
1076416	Oh, but please be careful therein, the castle staff oft forget to clean it methinks
1076415	If thou examineth the north wall most carefully, ye should find the entrance to milord's study!
1076414	The good Commander leant it to me, 'twas most kind!
1076413	Uh-huh! And we would read stories before bedtime, 'twas wonderful! I sleep on a pillow near the bed
1076412	Lord British once slept in that very room! It also hath a secret!
1076411	'Tis a wonderful library full of rare books and histories. A pity I am so small, or I would read more!
1076410	The nobles get odd looks upon their faces if I go there during meals... so I eat in the kitchen
1076409	I eat there every day, I highly recommend the brie!
1076408	We hath the finest cooks in all of Britannia here! Yep!
1076407	Most of these nobles visit from far away places, like Magincia or Moonglow. Some are very friendly!
1076406	They art quite kind, yet mostly stern in their duties
1076405	*teehee* Sometimes I sneak through the walls to fetch a quick snack. The guards sometimes leave out rations
1076404	Hmm, I wonder what 'twas built for...
1076403	'Twas once reserved for only the finest of horses for the Royal Guard, yet now anyone canst purchase a steed therein
1076402	Oh it's so pretty! I had forgotten how peaceful a place it could be
1076401	I hath but seen one once, yet now know why my liege feeleth so strongly of their power and dignity
1076400	A truly magical creature, rarely seen in these modern times
1076399	The silver serpent stands boldly 'pon the red field, a symbol of strength for all!
1076398	May Truth Be My Sword, Courage My Shield, And Love Guide Them Both. It speaketh well of the Three Principles
1076397	The red one over on yonder wall. It hath a wonderful inscription, but I do not know who Govannon Mac Lyr was
1076396	Oh yes, not like those from Magincia or Nujel'm 'tall!
1076395	Many a day and eve my lord sat there upon... *teehee* Yet it hath such an odd shape!
1076394	'Tis very spacious! It containeth the royal throne, a commemorative shield, and the Serpent Crest.
1076393	Oh, but I told it just a bit ago... mayhaps later?
1076392	'And if anyone sees me, oh what a disgrace, So I'd better discover a good hiding place!'
1076391	'I'm ruined,' he shouted, oh what'll I do! I'd rather be dead or go live in a zoo!'
1076390	And he suddenly realized the worst of his fears.
1076389	Then he felt with his paws just in back of his ears
1076388	At the cloud of black smoke drifting off to the south.
1076387	At first he just stared with a wide-open mouth
1076386	And came bobbing up with a head full of stubbles.
1076385	He leaped in kersplash! with a shower of bubbles,
1076384	Away through the jungle to Zamboozi Creek.
1076383	With a roar of surprise he took off like a streak,
1076382	Came down on his head and ignited his hair.
1076381	A flaming hot spark flew up into the air,
1076380	He received a most horrible, terrible shock.
1076379	One day as he sharpened his claws on a rock
1076378	And Hubert the Lion was due for a fall.
1076377	But conceit of this sort isn't proper at all
1076376	And especially proud of his elegant mane.
1076375	Hubert the Lion was haughty and vain
1076374	Hubert's Hair-Raising Adventure
1076373	little lonely... 'tis all...
1076372	cold...

1076354	Ick, stay away from me
1076353	Please, leave me be
1076352	Move along, vermin
1076351	A talking rat?
1076350	I'm too busy to talk
1076349	Stay away from me

1076242	So be it. 'I' must often repeat information when conversing with the life of Britannia, it seems.
1076241	Good. Tedious repetition should then be unnecessary on this occasion.

1076066	The World is fulfillment, the state of accomplishment, the realization of your goals. Your experiences combining into your whole self. This is when your dreams come true.
1076065	The Star represents inspiration, renewed hope for the future. It is the light at the end of the tunnel. The Star can be generous, opening the heart to give to others, with such actions bringing peace and serenity.
1076064	The Tower is the release, the sudden upheaval. You may experience a crisis, or a breakthrough. It is often humbling, toppling from the heights of ones ego, but can be a revelation as well.
1076063	Death is an ending, the closing of a door. The past is behind you. Shed old habits, and eliminate what is unnecessary. It also represents a transition, a humbling experience that will allow you to reach new heights.
1076062	The Hanged Man is at the end of his struggle; he has accepted his fate. Live in the moment. See things from a new perspective. Don't be afraid to change your ways.
1076061	Justice shows respect for fairness, honesty and ethics. Consider all sides of an issue. Seek balance in the decision to come. Accept responsibility for your decisions.
1076060	The Wheel of Fortune shows a turning point. Allow yourself to get swept up in events. Be involved, aware and have a greater perspective.
1076059	The High Priestess is inactive, passive, allowing things to take their own path. She is intuitive, and trusts herself, her dreams and her imagination. Be open to the bigger picture. Let events unfold as they may.
1076058	The Magus knows of his potential. He acts with focus, without distractions, and can be a powerful creative force, centered on producing the results he wants. Direct your talents to make what is possible reality.
1076057	The Fool stumbles headlong, blind, into danger, not seeing the consequences. You are starting on a new path. Trust that you will find your way.

1076025	Ask your question
1076024	The Inverted World does not fulfill. Accomplishments may not be as great as they seemed they would be. You may not have quite what they expected.
1076023	The Inverted Tower represents a sudden upheaval, a breakthrough on the horizon. An experience may not humble you as you need. A realization may be just out of reach.
1076022	The Inverted Star is uninspired. The light at the end of the tunnel may not be as bright as you had hoped. Could bring a mild calming, but not true serenity.
1076021	The Inverted Magus seeks, but has not yet found, his inner power. You may be distracted or your goals may not be clear enough. You may not be able to focus your energy in a clear direction.
1076020	The Inverted High Priestess is active in events where she should be more passive. Perhaps you cannot pull back to view the bigger picture objectively. You may be too involved.
1076019	The Inverted Hanged Man has not found conclusion; he has not accepted his fate. Your perspective may be too narrow to bring events to a close.
1076018	The Inverted Fool lacks the faith to begin a journey. You may not be ready to start anew. You may fear, based on past experience, to trust what you will find on this new path.
1076017	Inverted Justice seeks fairness, honesty, but truth is difficult to find. You may be unwilling to consider all options or unwilling to accept responsibility for your actions.
1076016	The Inverted Wheel does not spin. There is no movement to propel you in the direction you need to go. You may feel off your path, or unable to push ahead.
1076015	Death Inverted is the door that will not close, the old habit that returns to repeat a lesson. A transition, but perhaps not to the state you need.
1076014	Throw down your capes and kerchiefs! Let the petals be strewn! For the ~1_TITLE~ ~2_NAME~ approacheth!
1076013	~1_TITLE~ ~2_NAME~ approaches! Be ye prepared to kneel before their indomitable presence! And remember, tribute is to be only in gold!
1076012	Make way ye unwashed hordes! Clear the road! For ~1_TITLE~ ~2_NAME~ has business more important than yours!

1075991	This is not only the perfect altar for sacrificing valuables to the dark gods, it’s also a wonderful trash disposal unit. Whenever you put an item on the altar, a flame rises and consumes whatever is upon it.
1075990	When you pass in front of this mirror, you find that your reflection is paler, greener and well, more ghostly than you remember. Could it be you need more iron in your diet? More sun maybe? But wait, that’s not you at all. That’s just the nightmarish apparition that visits your mirror when you glance into it. And why does he have so many insulting things to say to you?
1075989	Stretch out on this gorgeous bed of razor sharp nails. Think of it as free acupuncture. Ignore the blood that seeps from your flesh as you sleep. The nails are rust proof.
1075988	No time to hunt for those annoyingly elusive Pixies? No problem! Mount these five real pixies on your trophy wall, their faces frozen in terror-filled grimaces. Delightful! And they squeal and beg and cry when you poke them. Tons of fun for the whole family!
1075987	The art you hang in your home tells the world who you are. If you hang these three paintings, you are telling the world that you have a heart of cold black evil. Created by Sosaria’s most disturbed painters, these three works of haunted art include: Lycanthropy, The Watcher and Withering Beauty. Watch them closely, as each has its own way of watching you.
1075986	Make a statement in your living room, a statement that says, I like my furniture to squeal when I sit on it. These handsome, handcrafted pieces are made of the bleached white bones of victims of various diseases, wars, tragedies and accidental deaths. Some of these bones still have a little life left in them.<br>

1043178	If thou art desirous of practice in a craft or skill, name it when thou askest for aid.
1043177	If thou namest a skill or ability, perhaps I can aid thee.
1043176	Without the name of a skill, 'tis difficult for me to teach thee.
1043175	I cannot teach thee if thou dost not name what to learn!
1043174	If thy desire is to learn, thou must say what thou wishest to learn.
1043173	A good blow on thy part. . . but not enough!
1043172	Aaaahh! I do bleed badly. . .
1043171	Oof! That didst hurt!
1043170	Away with thee scum!
1043169	Ow, thou didst get past my defenses!
1043168	'Twill take more than that to kill me!
1075768	A ~1_desire~! Many thanks to thee. Please accept this ~2_gift~.
1043167	Ouch! A touch indeed!.
1043166	A bare touch. . . Thou dost not wield thy weapon well!
1043165	Surely thou canst hit harder than that!
1043164	Pffft, thou fightest badly.
1043163	Barely a flesh wound. Cant thou not do better?
1043162	Ouch! Thou didst scratch me!
1043161	Thou art no match for me!
1043160	Thou dost hit only air!
1043159	Surely thou canst do better than that blow!
1043158	Thy aim is bad. . .
1043157	Thou didst miss, fool!
1043156	Ha! Thou art inept!
1043155	Have done with thee.
1043154	May thy shade wander the wilderness forever!
1043153	May thy soul rest in peace.
1043152	Thou shouldn’t not have fought me.
1043151	So perish those that challenge me!
1043150	There, that taketh care of thee.
1043149	Thou deservest to die!
1043148	Die, you weak, pathetic fool!
1043147	Thou shouldst not have messed with me!
1043146	Ha! I knew that I could do it!
1043145	I spit on thee. . .
1043144	I shall haunt thee for this deed!
1043143	I curse thee and thy offspring for this deed!
1043142	Curse thee!
1043141	Must I die?
1043140	Ooo. . . that doth hurt.
1043139	I hope the guards catch thee, scum!
1043138	Whatever shall my family do without me?
1075737	'Tis a difficult quest, but well worth it. Wilt thou reconsider?
1075736	Excellent. When thou hast satisfied the needs of the most humble, thou wilt be given an item meant for me. Take this <B>brass ring</B> to start ye on the way.
1075735	Thou art challenged to find seven citizens spread out among the towns of Britannia: Skara Brae, Minoc, Britain, and one of the towns upon an isle at sea. Each citizen wilt reveal some thought concerning Humility. But who doth best exemplify the virtue? Here, thou needeth wear this plain grey cloak, for they wilt know ye by it. Wilt thou continue?
1075734	Who's Most Humble
1075733	Very good! The library is of great import to the people of Britannia. Thou hath done a worthy deed and this is thy last required donation. I encourage thee to continue contributing to thine community, beyond the obligations of this endeavor.
1075732	Art thou having trouble? The Library lieth north of Castle British's gates. I believe the representatives in charge of the donations are easy enough to find. They await thy visit, amongst the many tomes of knowledge.
1075731	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075730	Impressive, thou art determined.
1075729	I have one more charity for thee, my diligent friend. Go forth and donate to the Britain Library and do that which is necessary to receive a special printing of ‘Virtue’, by Lord British. Once in hand, bring the book back with ye. Art thou ready?
1075728	Community Service – Library
1075727	Wonderful! The Zoo is a very special place from which people young and old canst benefit. Thanks to thee, it can continue to thrive.
1075726	Hello again. The zoo lies a short ways south of Moonglow. Close to the entrance thou wilt discover a small donation chest. That is where thou shouldest leave thy donation.
1075725	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075724	Good, thine path awaits
1075723	Now, go on and donate to the Moonglow Zoo. Givest thou enough to receive a 'For the Life of Britannia' sash. Once ye have it, return it to me. Wilt thou continue?
1075722	Community Service – Zoo
1075721	Terrific! The Museum is a worthy cause. Many will benefit from the inspiration and learning that thine donation hath supported.
1075720	Hello my friend. The museum sitteth in southern Vesper. If ye go downstairs, ye will discover a small donation chest. That is the place where ye should leave thy donation.
1075719	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075718	Very well, ye hath much work to do.
1075717	'Tis time to help out the community of Britannia. Visit the Vesper Museum and donate to their collection, and eventually thou wilt be able to receive a replica of the Shepherd's Crook of Humility. Once ye have it, return to me. Art thou willing to do this?
1075716	Community Service - Museum
1075715	I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.
1075714	Very good! I can see that ye hath more than just a passing interest in our work. There are many trials before thee, but I have every hope that ye shall have the diligence and fortitude to carry on to the very end. Before we begin, please prepare thyself by thinking about the virtue of Humility. Ponder not only its symbols, but also its meanings. Once ye believe that thou art ready, speak with me again.
1075713	Ah... no, that is not quite right. Truly, Humility is something that takes time and experience to understand. I wish to challenge thee to seek out more knowledge concerning this virtue, and tomorrow let us speak again about what thou hast learned.<br>
1075712	...that “I” am not “great”.
1075711	...the path to true glory.
1075710	...that pride is evil.

1075676	Wonderful! First, let us see if thou art reading from the same roll of parchment as we are. *smiles*
1075675	Greetings my friend! My name is Gareth, and I represent a group of citizens who wish to rejuvenate interest in our kingdom's noble heritage. 'Tis our belief that one of Britannia's greatest triumphs was the institution of the Virtues, neglected though they be now. To that end I have a set of tasks prepared for one who would follow a truly Humble path. Art thou interested in joining our effort?

I can cook a mean fish steak, and I'll split 'em with you! But make sure it's one of the green kind, they're the best for seasoning!

1075547	Inscribing... yes, you'll need a scribe's pen, some reagents, some blank scroll, and of course your own magery book. You might want to visit the magery shop if you're lacking some materials.
1075546	Hmm, thought I had your interest there for a moment. It's not everyday you see a book made from real daemon skin, after all!

1075544	Inscribe five 'Recall' scrolls
1075543	Do you know anything about 'Inscription?' I've been trying to get my hands on some hand crafted Recall scrolls for a while now, and I could really use some help. I don't have a scribe's pen, let alone a spellbook with Recall in it, or blank scrolls, so there's no way I can do it on my own. How about you though? I could trade you one of my old leather bound books for some.

1075538	That's right, move it! I need sixty logs on the double, and they need to be freshly cut! If you can get them to me fast I'll have your payment in your hands before you have the scent of pine out from beneath your nostrils. Just get a sharp axe and hack away at some of the trees in the land and your lumberjacking skill will rise in no time.

Could you fashion me some clock parts? I wish my own clocks to be right all the day long! You'll need some tinker's tools and some iron ingots, I think, but from there it should be just a matter of working the metal.
1075533	I see you found a good vien! Great!  This will help get this order out on time. Good work!
1075532	Hmmm… we need some more Ore. Try finding a mountain or cave, and give it a whack.
1075531	Not feeling strong enough today? Its alright, I didn't need a bucket of rocks anyway.
1075530	More Ore Please
1075529	Have a pickaxe? My supplier is late and I need some iron ore so I can complete a bulk order for another merchant. If you can get me some soon I'll pay you double what it's worth on the market. Just find a cave or mountainside and try to use your pickaxe there, maybe you'll strike a good vein! 5 large pieces should do it.
1075528	It's gorgeous! I only have a few things to give you in return, but I can't thank you enough! Maybe I'll even catch Uzeraan's eye at the, er, *blushes* I mean, I can't wait to wear it to the next town dance!
1075527	Hello again! Do you need anything? You may want to visit the tailor's shop for cloth and a sewing kit, if you don't already have them.
1075526	Won't you reconsider? It'd mean the world to me, it would!

1075522	Oh how I wish I had a fancy dress like the noble ladies of Castle British! I don't have much... but I have a few trinkets I might trade for it. It would mean the world to me to go to a fancy ball and dance the night away. Oh, and I could tell you how to make one! You just need to use your sewing kit on enough cut cloth, that's all.

1075518	Hail friend, hast thou a moment? A mishap with a saw hath left me in a sorry state, for it shall be a while before I canst return to carpentry. In the meantime, I need a comfortable chair that I may rest. Could thou craft a straw chair?  Only a tool, such as a dovetail saw, a few boards, and some skill as a carpenter is needed. Remember, this is a piece of furniture, so please pay attention to detail.
1075517	Comfortable Seating
1075516	Thanks for the help. Here's something for ya to remember me by.
1075515	Come On! Whats that... a bucket? We need ten bucklers... not spitoons.
1075514	Not enough muscle on yer bones to use it? hmph, probably afraid of the sparks markin' up yer loverly skin... to good for some honest labor... ha!... off with ya!
1075513	Craftsman's Satchel - Smithing
1075512	Hey there! Yeah... you! Ya' any good with a hammer? Tell ya what, if yer thinking about tryin' some metal work, and have a bit of skill, I can show ya how to bend it into shape. Just get some of ingots and a hammer and use it over here at this forge. You can always buy ingots at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine yer own. You can either make a smith's hammer yerself if ya have the tinkering skill, or buy it from a tinker at the market. I need a few more bucklers hammered out to fill this here order with...  hmmm about ten more. that'll give some taste of how to work the metal.
1075511	Battered Bucklers
1075510	(20) Arrows
1075509	Is all going well? I look forward to the simple comforts in my very own home.
1075508	Oh. Well. I'll just keep trying alone, I suppose...
1075507	*sighs* I think bowcrafting is a might beyond my talents. Say there, you look a bit more confident with tools. Can I persuade thee to make a few arrows? You could have my satchel in return... 'tis useless to me! You'll need a fletching kit to start, some feathers, and a few arrow shafts. Just use the fletching kit while you have the other things, and I'm sure you'll figure out the rest.

1075491	*glug* *glug* Ahh... Yes! Yes! That feels great! Those lizardmen will never know what hit 'em! Here, take this, I can get more from the lizards.
1075490	Just remember you need to use your mortar and pestle while you have empty bottles and some black pearl. Refresh potions are what I need.
1075489	Fine fine, off with *cough* thee then! The next time you see a lizardman though, give him a whallop for me, eh?
1075488	Help me! I am lost! You then, you an Alchemist? If you can make me a few Refresh potions, I will be back on my feet and can give those lizards the what for! Find a mortar and pestle, a good amount of black pearl, and ten empty bottles to store the finished potions in. Just use the mortar and pestle and the rest will surely come to you. When you return, the favor will be repaid.

1075486	I Shot an Arrow Into the Air...<br>
1075485	Well done!  I prepared this bag for thee. Take it, and I wish thee the best of luck in thy endeavors.
1075484	Return once ye have killed ten sheep with a bow and not a moment before.
1075483	Fair enough, the bow isn't for everyone. Good day then.
1075482	Truth be told, the only way to get a feel for the bow is to shoot one and there's no better practice target than a sheep. If ye can shoot ten of them I think ye will have proven yer abilities. Just grab a bow and make sure to take enough ammunition. Bows tend to use arrows and crossbows use bolts. Ye can buy 'em or have someone craft 'em. How about it then? Come back here when ye are done.
1075481	Thank you! I haven't been this excited about food in months!
1075480	Argh, I absolutely must have more of these 'cookies!' Come back if you change your mind.
1075479	You there! Do you know much about the ways of cooking? If you help me out, I'll show you a thing or two about how it's done. Bring me some cookie mix, about 5 batches will do it, and I will reward you. Although, I don't think you can buy it, you can make some in a snap! First get a rolling pin or frying pan or even a flour sifter. Then you mix one pinch of flour with some water and you've got some dough! Take that dough and add one dollop of honey and you've got sweet dough. add one more drop of honey and you've got cookie mix. See? Nothing to it! Now get to work!
1075478	Baker's Dozen
1075477	I am patient and can wait for you to master both the sword and wand.<br>And then our duel shall be etched into history.<br>Now it is time for you to learn. <br>Train, become strong and prepare. Study the ways carefully.<br>Plan for the day we will meet and face each other.<br>Until then, good day.
1075476	Years ago, in a time before the Gem was shattered, we could have been friends and companions.<br>Now I am trapped by the very fragments of that destroyed promise while you are still free to roam the world.<br>We are not enemies, but you have what I seek. Your freedom shall become mine.<br>That is why I brought you across the shards when the opportunity arose.
1075475	And this leads us to our final destination on your tour. <br>And perhaps a revelation or two.<br>You are standing in the center of Doom, one of the most dangerous places in Britannia.<br>You are safe for now, but beware should you return.<br>The abominations here won't be as tolerant next time. Nor will I.
1075474	Heartwood was not kept hidden, it has always been central to this world.<br>But methods of traveling into the heart of this tree were broken when the gem was shattered.<br>Heartwood is home to the Elves of Sosaria. Their culture is different, but we are learning to live together again.<br>Mostly.<br>You see, there remains a sect still loyal to Mondain.<br>They call themselves the Cult of the Fallen. <br>You may read more about them as you look further into the history of Britannia.
1075473	This waterfall is within the walls of the city of Zento, the main city of the Tokuno Islands.<br>Tokuno is home to Ninja and Samurai, as well as many mystical creatures.<br>The Tokuno Islands were once a part of a much larger landmass called the Land of the Feudal Lords.<br>A spell of protection was cast over what was left of the land after its near destruction. It remained hidden until recently.<br>Now it has once again become part of this world.<br>Speaking of rejoining our world, let's visit the Heartwood.
1075472	This is the Hedge Maze, or at least part of it.<br>It was built by Relvinian, a powerful, but mad magician who was fascinated by demons.<br>Some of his experiments are still alive, waiting for the next victim to reach the center of the maze.<br>Nobody is certain what happened to Relvinian. His disappearance remains a mystery to this day.<br>But enough of that.
1075471	You're standing in Luna, the Paladin city.<br>The buildings lining the walls of this city are houses owned and customized by the citizens of Britannia.<br>As you can see, some homeowners are masterful architects. Others prefer to spend their time dragon hunting and erect more simplistic abodes.<br>Homeowners may even hire personal vendors to sell wares from their home.<br>Some houses become famous for the design and the history surrounding them.
1075470	This is Haven. See that forge over there? Most cities have at least one.<br>The blacksmiths here sell simple armor and weapons but you'll learn how to craft better versions.<br>One day you may decide to become a tailor or an alchemist or maybe even a renowned carpenter.<br>Your bank vault may not have enough room to hold all of your wares so you'll need something a bit larger to store your possessions.
1075469	This is Britain, the largest city of Britannia.<br>More precisely, you're standing outside Britain's main bank.<br>Town centers, such as this bank, are likely places to find what, or who, you are looking for. <br>And when you can't find a needed item, you may be able to craft it.
1075468	Let me show you around your new home. <br>Look closely at the crystal ball before you.<br>It will transport you to places that will become part of your future. <br>I will remain with you only in spirit. <br>You may see others like yourself, but they will not be able to see you. <br>Ready to see Britannia?
1075467	Long ago, we existed as one society. <br>Then came that fateful day when Mondain's quest for power led to the destruction of the Gem of Immortality.<br>Now we live in worlds that closely resemble one another but we remain apart physically and spiritually.<br>But sometimes there's a shift, and people like you and I are able to pass through to one of the other realities. This reality.
1075466	Ah yes, you over there. Come here.<br>You seem a bit puzzled.<br>It happens to nearly everyone that comes through here. <br>You see, you've been here before. In a way we all came from this place. <br>Still puzzled? Let me explain further.

1075433	My shield! My family’s honor! You have my gratitude. Please, take this goblet. It is small enough repayment for all you have done for me, but it is the only thing of my family’s that I have left.
1075432	Go away and never come back.

1075428	Saved Honor
1075427	What do you want? Oh, that jewel merchant wants his shield back, eh?
1075426	The name of the villain is Jack, you will find him over by the port.
1075425	Ah well. You have already helped me by gathering the jewels. I cannot complain.
1075424	Deliver the bag of jewels to the loan shark.
1075423	Will you take the jewels to the loan shark? I am not well enough to go myself, though it is not far.
1075422	Jack the Villain
1075421	You have done it! Bless you! I do appreciate this very much! Though, will you do me one last favor?
1075420	Are you sure? You are very kind. Many of the monsters around here, when slain, are found to have jewels in their stomachs. From innocents they have eaten, no doubt.
1075419	I know how much I am asking. Please, can you not help a dying man restore his family’s honor?
1075418	Gather them quickly. Who knows how long Derek has to live?
1075417	I beg your pardon, but will you listen to my story? My family, the de Boors family, have been jewel traders as far back as anyone can remember. Alas, by the time I was born, we had fallen on hard times. <br>To survive, I have had to sell much of my family’s property. Most of it was meaningless, but I regret that a few years ago I made a terrible mistake. I pawned a shield bearing my family’s coat of arms to a loan shark. That shield was borne into battle by Jaan de Boors, the founder of our house! It has no value to anyone, but that blackguard won’t believe I have no money. He wants a fortune in jewels before he will return it.<br>Now I have learned that I am dying. Soon I will be gone, and my lineage with me. For the sake of what little honor is left to me and my family name, I cannot bear to leave our ancestral shield in the hands of that villain. Will you help me recover it?<br>
1075416	The Honor of the De Boors
1075415	Thanks for helping me out. You’re a real hero to my guards. Valor is its own reward, but maybe you wouldn’t mind wearing this sash. We don’t give these out to just anyone, you know!
1075414	There’s all kinds of daemons you can kill. There are some near the hedge maze, and some really powerful ones in Dungeon Doom.
1075413	What? You’re not scared of a couple of lousy daemons, are you?
1075412	Sash of Might
1075411	You’ve really inspired my trainees. They’re working harder than ever. I’ve got one more request for you, and it’s a big one. Those mongbats didn’t pose a problem. You mowed down the imps with no trouble. But do you dare take on a couple of daemons?
1075410	Doughty Warriors
1075409	Hah! I knew you were up to the challenge.
1075408	You won’t find many imps on this continent. Mostly, they’re native to Ilshenar. Might be a few up around the hedge maze east of Skara Brae, though.
1075407	You’re pretty sad. When I was a young warrior, I wasn’t one to walk away from a challenge.
1075406	Show them what a real warrior is REALLY made of!
1075405	You did great work. Thanks to you, my puppies are training harder than ever. I think they could actually take a mongbat now. I’m still worried they’ll slack off, though. What say you to slaying some Imps for me now? Show them how it’s really done?
1075404	Doughty Warriors
1075403	What? For me? Let me see . . . these sapphire earrings are for you, it says. Oh, she wants to offer me a job! This is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me! 
1075402	Take the packet and return it to the beggar who found my ring.
1075401	Hmph. Very well. What did you say his name was?
1075400	Transparent Heart
1075399	What’s that you say? It was a humble beggar that found my ring? Such honesty must be rewarded. Here, take this packet and return it to him, and I will be in your debt.
1075398	Regina’s Thanks
1075397	Didst thou find my ring? I thank thee very much! It is an old ring, and a gift from my husband. I was most distraught when I realized it was missing.
1075396	A jewel like this must be worth a lot, so it must belong to some noble or another. I would show it around the castle. Someone’s bound to recognize it.
1075395	I see. Too good to help an honest beggar like me, eh?
1075394	Find the ring’s owner.
1075393	Beg pardon, sir. I mean, madam. Uh, can I ask a favor of you? I found this jeweled ring.  Most people would sell it and keep the money, but not me. I ain't never stole nothing, and I ain't about to start. I tried to take it over to Brit castle, figgerin' it must belong to some highborn lady, but the guards threw me out. You look like they might let you pass. Will you take the ring over there and see if you can find the owner?

1075383	You’ll find mongbats all over the place. They’re a real pest. Once you’ve killed ten of them, come back and see me again.
1075382	Ah. I see. Never mind then.
1075381	Show them what a real warrior is made of!
1075380	Youngsters these days! Sorry, I didn’t introduce myself. I’m Kane, the Master of Arms for this city. This lot of trainees I got, they’re not worth a bucket of sour spit. You know the invasion some years back? Well, some of these pups weren’t even born then! What I need is an example, something that will put some steel into their spines. You seem pretty tough, what do you say to helping me out?
1075379	Doughty Warriors
1075378	She said what? She thinks what of me? I . . . I can’t believe it! All this time, I never knew how she truly felt. Thank you, my friend. I believe now I will be able to paint once again. Here, take this bleach. I was going to use it to destroy all of my works. Perhaps you can find a better use for it now.
1075377	Take the letter back to the Artist’s Guild in Britain, if you would do me this kindness.
1075376	Very well, then. If you will excuse me, I need to get ready.
1075375	Bleach
1075374	Emilio painted this? It is absolutely wonderful! I used to love looking at his paintings, but I don’t remember him creating anything like this before. Would you be so kind as to carry a letter to him? Fate may have it that I am to marry another, yet I am compelled to reveal to him that his love was not entirely unrequited.
1075373	Unfading Memories
1075372	I’m sorry, I’m getting ready to be married. I don’t have time to . . . what’s that you say?
1075371	The wedding is taking place in the palace in Nujel'm. You will likely find her there.
1075370	Alright then, you have already helped me more than I deserved. I shall find someone else to undertake this task.
1075369	The Artist’s gratitude.
1075368	Finished! With the pigment I was able to create from the Prismatic Amber you brought me, I was able to complete my humble work. I should explain. Once, I loved a noble lady of gentleness and refinement, who possessed such beauty that I have found myself unable to love another to this day. But it was from afar that I admired her, for it is not for one so lowly as I to pay court to the likes of her. You have heard of the fair Thalia, Lady of Nujel'm? No? Well, she was my Muse, my inspiration, and when I heard she was to be married, I lost whatever pitiful talent I possessed. I felt I must compose a portrait of her, my masterpiece, or I would never be able to paint again. You, my friend, have helped me complete my work. Now I ask another favor of you. Will you take it to her as a wedding gift? She will probably reject it, but I must make the offer.
1075367	Unfading Memories
1075366	Thank you my friend . . . I know she is at peace, now. Here, keep the weapon. Most of its power is expended, but it remains somewhat potent against wolf-kind.
1075365	My wife is hiding out in a cave on the north end of Ice Island. You will not be able to harm here, even with the weapon I gave you, until night falls and she transforms into a wolf.
1075364	I understand. I am no warrior, either. I suppose I shall have to wait here until one comes along.
1075363	Misericord
1075362	I came to this place looking for a cure for my wife. But I’m getting ahead of myself -- my wife was attacked by a werewolf, and survived. Now she has become a werewolf herself. My research has turned up nothing that would cure her affliction. *Sob* She begged me to end her suffering, but I cannot. She has removed herself to a remote part of Ice Island so that she does not endanger others. If I give you the means, will you go there, find her, and give her the mercy of a clean death? 
1075361	Gentle Blade
1075360	I knew it! See, it’s just the color I needed! Look how it brings out the highlights of her wheaten tresses!
1075359	You can find Prismatic Amber in the Prism of Light, located just north of the city of Nujel'm.
1075358	Is there no one who can help a humble artist pursue his Muse?
1075357	The joy of contributing to a noble artistic effort, however paltry the end product.
1075356	Aargh! It’s just not right! It doesn’t capture the unique color of her hair at all! If only I had some Prismatic Amber. That would be perfect. They used to mine it in Malas, but alas, those veins ran dry some time ago. I hear it may have been found in the Prism of Light. Oh, if only there were a bold adventurer within earshot who would go to the Prism of Light and retrieve some for me!

You can't be serious! *sag* My Freddie, my son! Thank you for carrying out his last wish. Here -- I made this for my son, to give to him when he became a journeyman. I want you to have it.
1075347	I don’t know how much longer Andros will survive. You’d better get this to him as quick as you can. Every second counts!
1075346	Well I’m sorry to hear you say that. Without your help, I don’t know if I can get these to Andros quickly enough to help him.
1075345	Andros’ Gratitude
1075344	That is simply terrible. First Andros, and now his son. Well, let’s make sure Frederic’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain. Will you take the bandages to his father? You can probably deliver them faster than I can, can’t you?
1075343	A Father’s Gratitude
1075342	How may I help thee? You have the silk of a dread spider? Of course I can make you a bandage, but what happened to Frederic?
1075341	Thank you! Deliver it to Leon the Alchemist in Vesper. The silk crumbles easily, and much time has already passed since I died. Please! Hurry!
1075340	Oh . . . that’s your decision . . . OooOoooOOoo . . . 
1075339	Hurry! You must get the silk to Leon the Alchemist quickly, or it will crumble and become useless!
1075338	My father, Andros, is a smith in Minoc. Last week his forge overturned and he was splashed by molten steel. He was horribly burned, and we feared he would die. An alchemist in Vesper promised to make a bandage that could heal him, but he needed the silk of a dread spider. I came here to get some, but I was careless, and succumbed to their poison. Please, won’t you help my father?

1075330	You won’t take this back to my daughter? Please, I cannot leave until she knows I am at peace.
1075329	Mirror of Purification
1075328	You tell me it is time to leave this flesh. I did not understand until now. I thought: I can see my wife and my daughter, I can speak. Is this not life? But now, as I regard my reflection, I see what I have become. This only a mockery of life. Thank you for having the courage to show me the truth. For the love I bear my wife and daughter, I know now that I must pass beyond the veil. Will you return this basin to Aurelia? She will know by this that I am at rest.
1075327	Aemaeth
1075326	What is this you give me? A basin of water?
1075325	My father - or what remains of him - can be found in the graveyard northwest of the city.
1075324	Oh! Alright then. I hope someone comes along soon who can help me, or I don’t know what will become of us.
1075323	Aurelia's gratitude.
1075322	My father died in an accident some months ago. My mother refused to accept his death. We had a little money set by, and she took it to a necromancer, who promised to restore my father to life. Well, he revived my father, all right, the cheat! Now my father is a walking corpse, a travesty . . . a monster. My mother is beside herself -- she won't eat, she can't sleep. I prayed at the shrine of Spirituality for guidance, and I must have fallen asleep. When I awoke, there was this basin of clear water. I cannot leave my mother, for I fear what she might do to herself. Could you take this to the graveyard, and give it to what is left of my father?

1075315	This brigand, Gregorio, you can find him in the farmland to the east of town. He usually wears a red skull cap and carries a pitchfork. 
1075314	Why? This man has killed many innocent people. Would you let him walk around, free?
1075313	Amulet of Righteousness
1075312	I was born and raised in Buc’s Den. Have you been there? Then you know what a lawless place it is. Five years ago, my mother and father were killed by brigands there. I was only a child, and so I was sent here to live with my uncle.<br>Recently, a man moved into town, and I’m sure this man is the one who killed my parents. The sheriff will do nothing, he doesn’t believe me. What can I do? I’m no warrior. I can’t use magic. I don’t have the courage to avenge my family. Please, if you have any love at all for justice, I beg of you, seek out and slay this criminal!

1075080	<h2>Vesper</h2><br>The City of Bridges<br><br> Vesper is a center for trade in Britannia, both overland from Minoc and Cove, and overseas from the major islands. Because of the continual influx of wealth, it is a city of playfulness and decadence where magic and the arts are in continued evidence. Beneath the surface, deception and corruption lurk,  however, and guards are common through the bridges and streets of the city.<br><br> Almost anything can be bought and sold in Vesper, and the numerous shops and places of learning sit on dozens of small islands in a river delta connected everywhere by beautiful bridges. As a center for trade, the city has attracted craftsmen and adventurers of every kind, and guilds for mages, miners, warriors, and fishermen can be found here.<br><br> For those inclined to dally, the museum of Vesper is an interesting side-trip for visitors to the city.<br><br> Adventure-seekers can find plenty of danger to the northeast, where dark forests hold dangerous monsters. The road north to Minoc and the long west road to Britain or Yew also offer danger, as thieves often lurk along these pathways in search of unwary travelers.<br><br> Amenities: Alchemist, Armorer, Bank, Baker, Beekeeper, Blacksmith, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Fish Shop, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Magic shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Tinker  
1075079	<h2>Skara Brae</h2><br>The City of Rangers<br><br> Skara Brae is a peaceful, clean city dedicated to the spirituality and the arts. The rangers and other folk who dwell therein are attuned to nature and the natural state, and they are very much at home in the forests of Britannia - so much so that their city extends from its main island into the forests on the west coast of Britannia proper.<br><br> The city itself is home to a guild of rangers and all manner of shops that one would visit before undertaking a long journey. Equipment for riding, traveling on shipboard, and walking is available, and supplies for self-preservation in times of danger abound.<br><br> Because the inhabitants of Skara Brae are more inclined to intellectualism than other warriors, they embrace both magical and physical combat, and both are well represented here.<br><br> For those seeking adventure in the wilds, a gate from the main island leads to the extension of the town along the coast of Britannia, and from there it is a short trip into the forests and swamps of the southern mainland where monsters and more mundane creatures abound.<br><br> Amenities: Animal Supplies, Armorer, Bank, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Magic Shop, Provisioner, Reagent Shop, Shipwright, Stable, Tailor, Tavern, Weapons Shop
1075078	<h2>Jhelom</h2><br>Mercenaries' Isle<br><br> Jhelom is a city run by warriors for warriors. Home of the famed Dueling Pit, the city offers the realm's best warriors a chance to test their skills in combat against one another in non-lethal combat. <br><br> Because of its large populace of warriors, Jhelom is a very rough-and-tumble city, but tightly enforced laws keep disorder to a minimum, and the pit allows disputes to be settled under carefully controlled circumstances.<br><br> Jhelom's military government has a general dislike for mages and things magical, so all magical shops are restricted to the tiny southernmost island of the chain, although shops occasionally offer magical weapons and armament for those who desire them. <br><br> Most of the commerce in the area, however, is dedicated to the trappings of physical combat and to training adventurers in its practice. Guilds for both warriors and armorers are to be found on the main island.<br><br>  As an island city, Jhelom is not particularly dangerous for starting adventurers, but a moongate on the central island offers daring adventurers a chance to enter the wilderness in search of danger and reward. Often, merchants and other travelers camp by the gate awaiting escort to Britain's other cities.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Baker, Bank, Blacksmith, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Fish Shop, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Mage Shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Tailor, Tavern, Tinker, Weapons, Woodworker<br>
1075077	<h2>Magincia</h2><br>Isle of Riches<br><br> Magincia is a fairly small island town known for the incredible wealth that it derives from the sea and from the practice of the magical arts. The city itself is beautiful to behold, with golden streets and majestic architecture. Honest tradesmen do not linger for long upon this isle, however, preferring to pass through the moongate upon its western edge in search of a more pleasing environment.<br><br> For those who seek to begin a career in Magincia, however, the city does offer guilds for fishermen and miners, and  a modest collection of shops. Little in the way of danger ever finds its way here, but the moongate does offer abundant danger on its other side.<br><br> For the visitor, Magincia's most impressive sites are its Parliament Building and the Temple to the Virtues - even if these are rarely practiced in the city.<br><br> Should an adventurer join the ranks of Magincia's elite and purchase a ship, the docks to the south of the city offer access to the many other islands nearby.<br><br> Amenities: Baker, Bank, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Magic Shop, Shipwright, Tailor, Tavern, Tinker
1075076	<h2>Trinsic</h2><br><br> The Walled City Trinsic, home of Britain's paladins, is known far and wide for its warriors, its code of honor, and its dedication to preserving and protecting the realm of Britannia. Any skill or item of equipment necessary for practicing the warrior's trade can be found in abundance within the city's towering city walls, including a number of guilds and meeting halls devoted to the art of combat.<br><br> Trinsic also offers a branch of the tinkers' guild for those of a more inventive nature and a fishermen's guild for those who wish to plumb the sea of its many treasures. <br><br> Due to its location on the dangerous southern end of the continent, Trinsic has frequent disputes with pirates, giants, ogres, and trolls that roam the surrounding coastline and countryside. Those who venture forth from Trinsic's gate and into the southern tip of the continent must be bold, indeed. <br><br> Within the city, visitors will find a fine natural garden, a number of attractive bridges spanning the river that splits the city, and excellent training halls and stables. The marketplace in the southeastern corner of the city is also worth visiting.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Baker, Bank, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Provisioner, Stable, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Weapons<br>
1075075	<h2>Moonglow</h2><br>The City of Magic<br><br> The mages' town of Moonglow has long been devoted to the study of things magical. Although there are enough amenities to suit any adventurer, much of this small island is devoted to magical commerce and entertainment. Those who wish to improve their skills as a mage or purchase magical implements often make their homes here.<br><br> For those scholars who are happy to reside here indefinitely, Moonglow offers several guilds for training in the magical arts, as well as a wide variety of shops devoted to spells, reagents, potions, and other magical gear. <br> Because Moonglow is on an island, it does not offer many opportunities for combat, but a nearby moongate offers access to the mainland for would-be adventurers who seek a wider world in which to adventure.<br><br> Newcomers to the town should be sure to visit the network of teleporters which reach all corners of the island, as well as the fine zoo in its southern portion and the telescope perched on its eastern edge. <br><br> Amenities: Alchemist, Armorer, Baker, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Herbalist, Provisioner, Reagent Shop, Tailor, Weapons, Woodworker 
1075074	<h2>Britain</h2><br>The City of Bards<br><br> The thriving city of Britain is the capital city of Britannia and home to the famed Lord British, ruler of the realm. An excellent home base for any professional starting out his career, Britain offers numerous opportunities for training, purchasing equipment, learning new skills, and experiencing the world's many social opportunities. Within the city, you will find examples of the best and worst that Britannia has to offer. Outside, every road presents an opportunity for danger and excitement, with roads leading to every part of Britain's mainland. For would-be adventurers, guild halls in the area offer training for prospective bards, miners, and warriors.<br><br> The most famous of Britain's many city landmarks is Lord British's enormous castle, found on the western side of the city. Also of interest are the many fine centers of learning and the arts, such as Lord British's Conservatory of Music, located just beyond his castle walls. Bards from all over Britannia come here to study their craft and to entertain one another through music.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Bank, Baker, Blacksmith, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Mage shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Stables, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Veterinarian
1075073	<h2>Minoc</h2><br>The Miners' Frontier <br><br> The city of Minoc has boomed in recent years, due to the rich veins of ore that can be found in the nearby mountains. Situated along the northern coast of Britannia, the city is a haven for the tinkers, miners, and blacksmiths who depend upon these abundant resources for their livelihood. Those who wish to begin a career in any of these arts, as well as prospectors who are willing to brave the danger-filled forests nearby, will find this town an excellent home. <br>Minoc is also interesting in its large population of gypsies and old-timers who have been mining since the town was a small hamlet. Because it is fairly distant from the rule of Lord British and has grown up quickly from very small beginnings to significant wealth, Minoc is a rough frontier town. Although guards keep the peace in the city streets, the surrounding countryside can be dangerous indeed. Travelers should beware of bandits, thieves, and prowling monsters.<br>Mount Kendall is one of Britannia's most famous mountains, known for its caves and rich ore veins.<br> For those seeking to learn a trade, Minoc offers guild halls for miners and warriors.<br><br> Amenities: Architect, Armorer, Bank, Blacksmith, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Provisioner, Stable, Tanner, Tavern, Tinker. 
1075072	<h2>Yew</h2><br>The City of Justice<br>Yew is a small, peaceful town nestled amongst the trees in the great forest of northwestern Britannia. Its people live at peace with the land, raising crops, tending flocks, and gathering wild plants for use in healing and magic. Because of its quiet, pastoral nature, Yew attracts many rangers in addition to the druids who founded it.<br>The druids are known for their ability to see things truly and without bias, and are responsible for having constructed the mighty Empath Abbey, which is found in the northern portion of the city. This place is a center for learning and self-reflection that draws travelers from the world over.<br>Because of their eternal quest to find justice and equality, the druids have also been given the responsibility for administering justice. The great courtroom on the far western edge of the city's boundaries has often been the site of momentous trials, and the prison beyond has been the home for many dangerous criminals.<br>In the heart of Yew, a magical portal has been opened that allows access to the great elven home, The Heartwood. The druids of Yew and the elves of the Heartwood have been exchanging good will through ambassadors, though there have been claims of hostile factions on both sides.<br> For those interested more in adventure than in history or peace, the wilderness around Yew is wild, indeed. A small number of shops provide the needs for adventurers with the skills to brave the wilds, but little is offered in the way of further training, as no guilds make their homes here.<br>Amenities: Baker, Bank, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Tanner

1074996	I hear sloshing ... that must mean you've got my water samples.  Whew, I'm so glad you braved the dangers in there ... I mean, I would have but I'm so busy out here.  Here's your reward!
1074995	Heya!  You're back.  Was Iosep able to help?  Let me see what he's sent.
1074994	Great thought!  Bone might just do the trick.
1074993	You're back with the bark already?  Terrific!  I bet this will do the trick.
1074992	Have you got the granite and diamonds?  Great, let me see them and we'll see what effect this venom has upon them.
1074991	Greetings.  What have you there?  Ah, a sample from a poisonous tree, you say?  My friend Jamal sent you?  Well, let me see that then, and we'll get to work.

1074972	I'm sure Jamal is eager to get this information.  He's probably still hanging around near that big old blighted tree.
1074971	I'm thinking we need something fairly brittle or it won't hold an edge.  And, it can't be alive, of course.
1074970	I think a lumberjack can help supply bark.
1074969	If you're a miner, you should have no trouble getting that stuff.  If not, you can probably buy some samples from a miner?
1074968	My friend, Iosep, is a weaponsmith in Jhelom.  If anyone can help us, he can!
1074967	Oh.  Right, I guess you're really ... ah ... busy too.
1074966	Well, okay.  I guess I thought you'd want to see this through.
1074965	Sure, no problem.  I thought you were interested in figuring this out.
1074964	Okay.  If you change your mind, I'll probably still be stuck here trying to get in.
1074963	(10) workable samples
1074962	A step closer to entering Blighted Grove.
1074961	Wonderful!  Now we can both get in there!  Let me show you these instructions for making this machete.  If you're not skilled in smithing, I'm not sure how much sense it will make though.  Listen, if you're heading in there anyway … maybe you'd do me one more favor?  I'm ah ... buried in work out here ... so if you'd go in and get me a few water samples, I'd be obliged.
1074960	We're in business!  I've put together the instructions for chopping sort of sword, in the style of one of those new-fangled elven machetes.  Take those back to Jamal for me, if you would.
1074959	Amazing!  The bark was reduced to ash in seconds.  Whatever this taint is, it plays havok with living things.  And of course, it took the edge off both diamonds and granite even faster.  What we need is something workable but dead; something that can hold an edge without melting.  See what you can come up with, please.
1074958	Hmm, I've never even heard of something that can damage diamond like that.  I guess we'll have to go with plan B.  Let's try something similar.  Sometimes there's a natural immunity to be found when you use a substance that's like the one you're trying to cut.  A sort of "sympathetic" thing.  Y'know?
1074957	This is some nasty stuff, that's for certain.  I don't even want to think about what sort of blight caused this venomous reaction from that old tree.  Let's get to work … we'll need to try something really hard but still workable as our base material.  Nothing's harder than stone and diamond.  Let's try them first.
1074956	Heya!  I'm sure glad to see you.  Listen I'm in a bit of a bind here.  I'm supposed to be gathering poisoned water at the base of that corrupted tree there, but I can't get in under the roots to get a good sample.  The branches and brush are so tainted that they can't be cut, burned or even magically passed.  It's put my work at a real standstill.  If you help me out, I'll help you get in there too.  Whadda ya say?

1074750	Momento!
1074749	Ha ha!  This just goes to prove that there's no request that someone is not willing to fuffilll.  Well done my friend!
1074748	It's rare to find someone who shares my aversions and is willing to take immediate measures.  I'm glad we met.
1074747	Are you one of THEM?  Ahhhh!  Oh, wait, if you were them, then you'd be me.  So you're -- you.  Good job!
1074746	Perhaps I was unclear.  You'll know them when you see them, because you'll see you, and you, and you.  Hurry now.
1074745	You just don't understand the gravity of the situation.  If you did, you'd agree to my task.

1074742	When I was a child I was savaged by a Cu'Sidhe.  It ran up and slobbered all over me. Long story short:  it was horrible, I was traumatized and I've never been the same since.  Look at me now.  Kill them, kill them all.  Well at least a few.
1074741	Drool
1074740	You know them, don't you.  The three?  They look like you, you'll see. They looked like me, I remember, they looked like, well, you'll see.  The three.  They'll drive you mad too, if you let them.  They are trouble, and they need to be slain.  Seek them out.
1074739	Guile, Irk and Spite
1074738	A Feather in Yer Cap
1074737	I've seen how you strut about, as if you were something special. I have some news for you, you don't impress me at all. It's not enough to have a fancy hat you know.  That may impress people in the big city, but not here. If you want a reputation you have to climb a mountain, slay some great beast, and then write about it.  Trust me, it's a long process.  The first step is doing a great feat.  If I were you, I'd go pluck a feather from the harpy Saliva, that would give you a good start.
1074736	The path to greatness isn't for everyone obviously.
1074735	If you're going to get anywhere in the adventuring game, you have to take some risks.  A harpy, well, it's bad, but it's not a dragon.
1074734	The hero returns from the glorious battle and - oh, such a small feather?
1074733	Greets!  How can I … oh.  Oh no!  Is that … my darling Thorvald!  *quiet weeping*  Thank you for your kindness in returning this to me.  It means … a lot.  *sniffle*
1074732	The name 'Belulah' is the only clue you find on the medallion.
1074731	Or you could keep the medallion instead.
1074730	Ah, the tail.  You did it!  You know the rumours about dried ground hydra tail powder are all true?  Thank you so much!
1074729	Em, I thought I had explained already.  Abscess, the hydra, you know? Lots of heads but just the one tail.  I need the tail. I have my reasons. Go go go.
1074728	Well, the beast will still be there when you are ready I suppose.
1074727	I've heard of you, adventurer.  Your reputation is impressive, and now I'll put it to the test. This is not something I ask lightly, for this task is fraught with danger, but it is vital.  Seek out the vile hydra Abscess, slay it, and return to me with its tail.

1074723	I understand.  I don't like snakes much either.  They're so creepy.
1074722	Those really big snakes like swamps, I've heard.  You might try the blighted grove.

1074712	Here's what I need ... there are some creatures called hydra, fearsome beasts, whose scales are especially suitable for a new sort of armor that I'm developing.  I need a few such pieces and then some supple alligator skin for the backing.  I'm going to need a really large piece that's shaped just right ... the tail I think would do nicely.  I appreciate your help.
1074711	Scale Armor
1074710	I'm working on a striking necklace -- something really unique -- and I know just what I need to finish it up.  A huge fang!  Won't that catch the eye?  I would like to employ you to find me such an item, perhaps a snake would make the ideal donor.  I'll make it worth your while, of course.
1074709	The plight of the forest is staggering, all the more so because some of the tainted creatures are reproducing.  I am working to develop a natural means to prevent these corrupted seedlings from taking root, but without samples of such seeds, I'm forced to guess wildly what might work.  Will you harvest some tainted bogling seeds for me?
1074708	A Bad Seed
1074707	You've saved my life!  Oh thank you!  I can't repay you for your kindness but please, take this.
1074706	*whimper* Please ... hurry.  I am a good climber and could get out the way you came in, if you can just get me there.
1074705	Please!  PLEASE!  Don't let me die here.
1074704	Please, please I beg of you ... help out of here.  I was trying to find one of my sheep that went missing and I fell down this hole.  Then these ... *hysterical weeping*.  Please, get me out of here!
1074703	Hello.  Oh, what's that?  My trunk!  What happened to it?  Well nevermind that.  Thank you!  Here's payment for your trouble.
1074702	The acid damaged coffer is etched with the name 'Belulah'.
1074701	The disintegrating strongbox belonged to Jelrice.
1074700	The steaming box is etched with the name of Aeluva.
1074699	The box doesn't look like it will survive the acid for much longer anyway.
1074698	You have discovered an acid covered strongbox.  Perhaps the owner would pay for its return before the corrosive substance destroys it.  Do you wish to return the box?
1074697	The arcane daemons that worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074696	The succubi that have congregated within the sinkhole to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074695	The moloch daemons that have congregated to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?<br>
1074694	The daemons that have congregated to worship Paroxysmus pose a tremendous danger. Will you enter the lair and see to their destruction?
1074693	Vile creatures have exited the sinkhole and begun terrorizing the surrounding area.  The demons are bad enough, but the elementals are an abomination, their poisons seeping into the fertile ground here.  Will you enter the sinkhole and put a stop to their depredations?
1074692	Some of the most horrific creatures have slithered out of the sinkhole there and begun terrorizing the surrounding area.  The plague creatures are one of the most destruction of the minions of Paroxysmus.  Are you willing to do something about them?
1074691	You still need to kill those troglodytes, remember?
1074690	Probably the wiser course of action.
1074689	Oh nevermind, you don't look capable of my task afterall.  Haha!  What was I thinking -- you could never handle killing troglodytes.  It'd be suicide.  What?  I don't know, I don't want to be responsible ... well okay if you're really sure?
1074688	Troglodytes!
1074687	Ah! So soft, so supple.  What a wonderful texture.  Here you are ... my thanks.
1074686	I've told you all I know of the creature.  Until you return with Grobu's fur I can't finish my cloak.
1074685	I have created a masterpiece!  And all I need to finish it off is the fur of a bear.  But not just ANY bear -- oh no, no, that wouldn't do.  I've heard tales of a mighty beast, Grobu, who is bonded to the leader of the troglodytes.  Only Grobu's fur will do.  Will you retrieve it for me? 
1074684	New Cloak
1074683	Not half bad.  Here's your prize.
1074682	The trog chief and his mutt should be easy enough to find.  Just kill them and report back.  Easy enough.
1074681	A Trog and His Dog
1074680	I don't know if you can handle it, but I'll give you a go at it.  Troglodyte chief -- name of Lurg and his mangy wolf pet need killing.  Do the deed and I'll reward you.
1074679	Bravo!  These fetishes are just what I needed.  You've earned this reward.
1074678	I don't really want to know where you get the primitive fetishes, as I can't support the destruction of their lifestyle and culture. That would be wrong.
1074677	I've always been fascinated by primitive cultures -- especially the artifacts.  I'm a collector, you see.  I'm working on building my troglodyte display and I'm saddened to say that I'm short on examples of religion and superstition amongst the creatures.  If you come across any primitive fetishes, I'd be happy to trade you something interesting for them.
1074676	Grobu's Fur
1074675	Primitive Fetish
1074674	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal hydras.
1074673	You have done well.  Enjoy this reward.
1074672	You must not waste time. Do not suffer these crystalline abominations to live.
1074671	These abominations must not be permitted to fester!
1074670	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal vortices.
1074669	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal lattice seekers.
1074668	Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal daemons.
1074667	My friend, you've returned -- with items for me, I hope?  I have a generous reward for you.
1074666	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those icy hearts.
1074665	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those crystalline fragments.
1074664	I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those essences.
1074663	*nods*
1074662	You look strong and brave, my friend.  Are you strong and brave?  I only ask because I am known to be too generous to those that find for me interesting -- things -- to use in my smithing.  What do you say?
1074661	You've found it?  My lucky dagger!
1074660	*sniffles*  The dagger was stolen by some dishonest man.  Or perhaps I dropped it.  That doesn't matter though.  All that matters is that you find my dagger and return it.
1074659	*wailing cries* Then begone if you will not help a poor man in need.
1074658	Oh, the trauma!  *weeps loudly*  My lucky dagger has been lost.  It was given to me by my father, as a final gift before he died.  That blade has been an heirloom of my family for generations.  I must have it back.  *sniffles pathetically*  Please, find my lucky dagger.
1074657	I am overjoyed with your efforts!  Your devotion to Sosaria is noted and appreciated.
1074656	An explorer discovered the cave system under Nu'Jelm.  He made multiple trips into the place bringing back fascinating crystals and artifacts that suggested the hollow place in Sosaria was inhabited by other creatures at some point.  You'll need to follow in his footsteps to find this abomination and destroy it.
1074655	Perhaps I thought too highly of you.
1074654	The most incredible tale has reached my ears!  Deep within the bowels of Sosaria, somewhere under the city of Nu'Jelm, a twisted creature feeds.  What created this abomination, no one knows ... though there is some speculation that the fumbling initial efforts to open the portal to The Heartwood, brought it into existence.  Regardless of it's origin, it must be destroyed before it damages Sosaria.  Will you undertake this quest? 
1074653	Shhhh!  What have YOU done to that book?  It's covered in ... is that blood?  *furious glare*  Let me see that.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Do you realize how important this journal is?  Here, take this for your trouble.
1074652	The librarian in Britain would be glad of your donation of Lord Denthe's journal.
1074651	Or, you could keep the journal for your private library.
1074650	You have discovered a blood-stained journal that details the adventures of Lord Denthe.  The pages make for fascinating reading, telling the tale of the great man's efforts to uncover the secrets of the Prism of Light.  Will you donate the journal to a library so others may hear the tale of Lord Denthe's final expedition?
1074649	Thank you.  I haven't the words to express my gratitude.
1074648	The lush and fertile land where Dread Horn now lives is twisted and tainted, a result of his corruption.  The fey folk have sealed the land off through their magics, but you can enter through an enchanted mushroom fairy circle.
1074647	How can you not feel as I do?
1074646	Can you comprehend it? I cannot, I confess.  The most pristine and perfect Lord of Sosaria has fallen prey to the blight.  From the depths of my heart I mourn his corruption; my thoughts are filled with pity for this glorious creature now tainted.  And my blood boils with fury at those responsible for the innocent creature's undoing.  Will you find Dread Horn, as he is now called, and free him from this misery?
1074645	Dreadhorn
1074644	Here to collect on a bounty?
1074643	I can't pay a bounty if you don't bring bag the ears.
1074642	Suit yourself.
1074641	I've heard ... there's some that will pay a good bounty for pointed ears, much like we used to pay for each wolf skin.  I've got nothing personal against these elves.  It's just business.  You want in on this?  I'm not fussy who I work with.
1074640	Pointy Ears
1074639	Orders from Minax
1074638	*disinterested stare*  What?  Oh, you've gotten your form filled in.  How nice.  *glare*  And I'd hoped you'd drop this charade before I was forced to rub your nose in it.  *nasty smile*  You're not even a student and as such, you're not eligible for a refund -- you've never paid tuition.  For your services, Master Gnosos has recommended you receive pay.  So here.  Now go away.
1074637	Just head out the main gates there and you'll find yourself embracing the iron maiden in the Bloodletter's Guild.
1074636	Great! If you're going to stick around here, I know we have more tasks for you to perform.
1074635	Well, there you are.  I've added my signature to that of Gorrow, so you should be set to return to Mistress Aernya and get your tuition refunded.
1074634	Tuition Reimbursement
1074633	Pulled it off huh?  Well then you've earned this signature!
1074632	No signature for you until you kill off some of the shambling dead out there and destroy that blasted horse.
1074631	No signature for you.
1074630	I'm not signing any forms until the situation here is under control.  So, you can either help out or you can forget getting your tuition refund.  Which will it be?  Help control the shambling dead?
1074629	Convince Me
1074628	Made it through did you?  Did you happen to see Red Death out there?  Big horse, skeletal ... burning eyes?  No?  What's this?  Forms?  FORMS?  I'm up to my eyebrows in ravenous out-of-control undead and you want a signature?
1074627	What are you waiting for?  The iron maiden is still the portal to Bedlam.
1074626	Coward.
1074625	Completed Tuition Reimbursement Form
1074624	I wouldn't be too smug just yet, whiner.  You still need Master Gnosos' signature before I can cut your refund.  Last I heard, he's coordinating the recovery of the portions of the college that are currently overrun.  *nasty smile*  Off with you.
1074623	Not Quite That Easy
1074622	What?  Hrmph.  Gorrow signed your form did he?  Let me see that.  *squint*
1074621	You better hurry back to Mistress Aernya with that signed form.  The college only has so much money and with enough claims you may find yourself unable to get your tuition refunded.  *wink*
1074620	Giving up on your scheme eh?  Suit yourself.
1074619	Now that I've signed your papers you'd better get back to that witch Aernya.  Mmmm mmm smell those ribs!
1074618	Fooling Aernya
1074617	Oh excellent, you're back.  I'll get the oven going.  That thing about pixie legs, you see, is that they burn and dry out if you're not really careful.  Taste just like chicken too!
1074616	I'm something of a gourmet, you see.  It's tough getting some of the ingredients, though.  Bring me back some pixie legs, unicorn ribs and ki-rin brains and I'll sign your form.
1074615	Hehehe.  Your choice.
1074614	Signed Tuition Reimbursement Form
1074613	Pixie Leg

1074609	Heh.  Heheheh.  Good one.  You're not a Bedlam student and you're definitely not eligible for a tuition refund.  Heheheh. That old witch Aernya doesn't see as well as she used to you know.  Otherwise, she would have ... hmmm, wait a minute.  I sense a certain 'opportunity' here.  I'll sign your forms in return for a little help with a project of my own.  What do you say?
1074608	You Scratch My Back
1074607	Oh blast!  Not another of those forms.  I'm so sick of this endless paperwork.
1074606	If you're not willing to follow the proper process then go away.
1074605	You're not getting a refund without the proper forms and signatures.
1074604	The slimy ointment continues to protect you from the corrosive river.

1074587	*smile* Greetings!  Oh ... oh my.  Oh, goodness ... *startled gasp*  Did you read ... we must report this at once.
1074586	It might be safest to deliver the letter to someone trustworthy that isn't too important.  Sarakki the Notary might be a good choice.
1074585	Probably a wise choice to keep a low profile.
1074584	You have discovered a private letter from the sorceress Minax to her dear friend "Travesty" that implicates some very important people in her pay.  Will you risk drawing attention to yourself by delivering the bundle to the castle in Britain?<br>
1074583	Isn't that interesting?  Someone was willing to pay a lot of gold to see me gone.  You've earned a reward for bringing this to me.
1074582	Ah!  You found my property.  Thank you for your honesty in returning it to me.
1074581	Well hello there. Oh.  Wait a minute, you're not here to plead the case of that traitor Danoel are you?
1074580	Is that my bucket? I had to ditch my favorite bucket when a group of ratmen jumped me!

1074574	What do you want?  Wonderful, another whining request for a refund on tuition.  You know, experiences like that are invaluable ... and infrequent.  Having the opportunity to test yourself under such realistic situations isn't something the college offers all students.  Fine. Fine.  You'll need to submit a refund request form in triplicate before I can return your 1,000,000 gold tuition.  You'll need to get some signatures and a few other odds and ends.

1074555	I cannot grant you the ability to pass through the bull-men's defenses without the gaman horns.
1074554	Oh come now, don't be afraid.  The magic won't harm you.
1074553	Interesting.  I believe I have a way.  I will need some materials to infuse you with the essence of a bull-man, so you can fool their defenses.  The most similar beast to the original Baratarian bull that the minotaur were bred from is undoubtedly the mighty Gaman, native to the Lands of the Feudal Lords.  I need horns, in great quantity to undertake this magic.

Hmmm, I would have you go there and seek out these warriors to see if they might join our cause.  But, legend speaks of a mighty barrier to prevent invasion of the city.  Take this map to Canir and explain the problem. Perhaps she can devise a solution.<br>
1074545	Ah ha!  You see here ... and over here ... The map fragment places the city of the bull-men, Labyrinth, on that piece of Sosaria that was thrown into the sky.

1074542	What have you found?
1074541	You have discovered an important clue!
1074540	I care not how you get the information.  Kill as many humans as you must ... but find the fate of the minotaurs.  Perhaps another of the Gemkeeper's servants has the knowledge we seek.
1074539	A traveler has told me that worshippers of Mondain still exist and wander the land.  Perhaps their lore speaks of whether the bull-men survived.  I do not think they share their secrets gladly.  You may need to be 'persuasive'.
1074538	I am disappointed, but I respect your decision.
1074537	Here we honor the Gemkeeper's Apprentice and seek to aid her efforts against the humans responsible for the death of her teacher -- and the destruction of the elven way of life.  Our tales speak of a fierce race of servants of the Gemkeeper, the men-bulls whose battle-skill was renowned.  It is desireable to discover the fate of these noble creatures after the Rupture.  Will you seek information?
1074536	Warriors of the Gemkeeper
1074535	The lore of my people mentions Mondain many times.  In one tale, it is revealed that he created and enslaved a race -- a sort of man bull, known as a 'minotaur'.  The tales speak of mighty warriors who charged with blood-soaked horns into the heat of battle.  But, alas, the fate of the bull-men is unknown after the rupture.  Will you seek information about their civilization?

1074530	Ahhhh!  Don't you feel great?  Struggle is good for the soul.
1074529	You're not making much progress in the honing-mind-and-body department, are you?
1074528	My way of life isn't for everyone, that's true enough.
1074527	It's all about hardship, suffering, struggle and pain.  Without challenges, you've got nothing to test yourself against -- and that's what life is all about.  Self improvement!  Honing your body and mind!  Overcoming obstacles ... You'll see what I mean if you take on my challenge.
1074526	Grandfather's farm is a ways west of the Shrine of Spirituality. So, we're not quite there yet.  Thank you again for keeping me safe.
1074525	I hope my grandfather will be alright.
1074524	Oh!  I just don't know what to do.  My mother is away and my father told me not to talk to strangers ... *worried frown*  But my grandfather has sent word that he has been hurt and needs me to tend his wounds.  He has a small farm southeast of here.  Would you ... could you ... escort me there safely?
1074523	Hey, if you have cargo for me, you can start unloading over here.

1074519	Ho there!  There's nothing quite like a day's honest labor to make you appreciate being alive.  Hey, maybe you'd like to help out with this project?

1074474	You decided that drinking this would be a bad idea.  However, drop this into a full keg of poison would increase the deadliness.
1074473	You pour the noxious liquid into the keg.
1074472	That poison would not be affected.

1074462	The best thing about my job is that I do a little bit of everything, every day.  It's what we're good at really.  Just picking up something and making it do something else.  Listen, I'm really low on parts.  Are you interested in fetching me some supplies?
1074461	Oh, hello there.  What do you have for me?
1074460	If I knew where my cousin was, I'd make the delivery myself.
1074459	That's okay, I'll find someone else to make the delivery.
1074458	Be careful down there. I don't like losing customers.
1074457	The price isn't going to change.  It's 5,000 per rope please.
1074456	I sure don't want to go down there either.  You won't hear me chiding you. In fact, I commend your intellect.
1074455	You won't be able to get into the sinkhole with any normal rope.  It's a big drop, sure, but the real problem is the acid and poison gas.  See, most ropes can't stand up to that kind of treatment, even for a short period of time.  So you'll need a special rope -- a magical rope. Like these ones I happen to have available here for a mere 5,000 gold each.
1074454	Watch Your Step
1074453	Best of luck!  Watch out for Lady Melisande.  She's a nasty one.
1074452	What kind of adventurer are you that you can't afford to outlay some gold on good equipment.  You'll need this machete to get under those roots.  It's a good price.
1074451	Yah, you didn't like like you could handle it.  Probably just as well.
1074450	Ho there!  If you wish to cross and test yourself in the Blighted Grove, you'll need a special machete.  Luckily I have one right here and it's for sale!  Only 1,000 gold each.
1074449	Dangerous Crossing
1074448	Step right up!  Thank you, enjoy the amazing caverns.
1074447	Dig into those pockets Lords and Ladies!  Just ten-thousand-shiny-gold-coins and you'll be walking in the bootsteps of the famous Lord Denthe himself!
1074446	C'mon now Lords and Ladies -- you're passing up the opportunity of a lifetime.  Is 10,000 gold too much to pay for your enlightenment?
1074445	Step right up!  Step right up!  Lords and Ladies, this is your opportunity to view the find of a lifetime!  What magical energy caused the fascinating play of light and darkness within these subterranean passageways?  What mysterious forces are at work deep within the Prism of Light?  Admission tickets are good for a full day of adventure and excitement and well worth the price at 10,000 gold. Whadda ya say?
1074444	Wonders of the Natural World
1074443	Ah!  You've got my pages?  Oh no ... they've been damaged.  Here, take this key.  Perhaps you can find the podium and gain access to the library.  My poor books are being ravaged by that horror and you'd do well to put things right.
1074442	Most of the creatures here wouldn't be interested in my thesis.  *nervous chuckle*  Master Gnosos would argue that no one is -- not even the undead.  Still, I'd wager that the more powerful undead have my pages.
1074441	*tense sigh* Of course, I understand.  If you change your mind, I'll be waiting.
1074440	Disintegrating Thesis Notes
1074439	Shhh!  *nervous chuckle* Oh, sorry about that.  I forget that I'm not in the library any longer -- and instead that THING has taken over.  If that wasn't distressing enough, I've misplaced my thesis pages and they've been gathered up by the shambling dead.  Could you retrieve them for me?
1074438	Misplaced
1074437	Oh!  You've returned.  I cannot thank you enough for saving me.  I only hope Melisande doesn't return them to life once more.  Bless you, fair adventurer. Bless you.  If you wish to face Melisande in battle, place the token of my blessing in the basket.  May you be triumphant and redeem us all through your efforts.
1074436	Until my sisters have been treated with mercy and released from their twisted existence and until the vile Saliva is slain, I cannot feel safe or bestow my blessing.
1074435	Please, I'm so frightened.  I don't want to become twisted and corrupt.  Please free me!
1074434	Oh help! Help me!  I don't want to end up like my sisters, enslaved by the cruel Melisande.  I cannot flee, I am bound here by the evil of the harpy Saliva.  Won't you please help me and redeem my sisters at the same time?  I will grant you my blessing in return.

1074413	You must yet perform these deeds: 
1074412	You have made a good start but have more yet to do.
1074411	Or turn away and embrace your heritage.  It matters not to me.
1074410	You have proven yourself capable and commited and so I will grant you the transformation you seek.
1074409	Seek out a human in need and prove your worth as a defender of humanity.  Seek Belulah in Nu'Jelm and heartily challenge the elements in a display of toughness to rival any human.
1074408	Seek Sledge the Versatile and learn about human ingenuity and creativity.  Seek Patricus and demonstrate your integrity and strength.
1074407	But you must prove yourself to me.  Humans possess a strength of character and back.  Humans are quick-witted and able to pick up a smattering of nearly any talent.  Humans are tough both mentally and physically.  And of course, humans defend their own -- sometimes with their own lives.
1074406	Violent change marked the sundering of our ties.  We are different -- elves and humans.  And yet we are much alike.  I can give an elf the chance to walk as a human upon Sosaria.  I can undertake the transformation.
1074405	Elves and humans; we lived together once in peace.  Mighty relics that attest to our friendship remain, of course.  Yet, memories faded when the Gem was shattered and the world torn asunder.  Alone in The Heartwood, our elven brothers and sisters wondered what terrible evil had befallen Sosaria.
1074404	Perhaps you have heard of the service I offer?  Perhaps you wish to avail yourself of the opportunity I lay before you.
1074403	Greetings, traveler and welcome.
1074402	Special Hair Dye
1074401	You are bald!
1074400	Or do none of these things.  You must choose your own path in the world, and what use you'll make of your existence.
1074399	Seek the Huntsman, the centuar tasked with maintaining the balance.  And lastly seek Arielle, the pixie, who has perhaps the most important lesson -- not to take yourself too seriously.
1074398	Seek Strongroot, the great treefellow, whose very roots reach to the heart of the world.  Seek Enigma, whose wisdom can only be conveyed in riddles and rhymes.  Seek Bravehorn, the great hart, who exemplifies the fierce dedication of a protector of his people.

1074383	Your shot sends forth a wave of psychic energy.
1074382	You are struck by a force arrow!
1074381	You fire an arrow of pure force.
1074380	This humanoid is already controlled by someone else.
1074379	You cannot charm that!
1074378	The humanoid becomes enraged by your charming attempt and attacks you.
1074377	You allure the humanoid to follow and protect you.
1074376	Your enemy shrugs off the poisonous bite.
1074375	You are assaulted with great force!
1074374	You attack your enemy with the force of nature!
1074373	A sea horse has hatched overnight in the tank.

1074368	The tank looks worse than it did yesterday.
1074367	The tank looks healthier today.
1074366	An unfortunate accident has left a creature floating upside-down.  It is starting to smell.
1074365	A new creature has hatched overnight in the tank.

1074360	You receive a reward: ~1_REWARD~
1074359	The reward would not fit in your pack.
1074358	No reward is pending.
1074357	Well, I don't mind saying it -- I'm flabbergasted!  Absolutely astonished.  I just heard that some elves want to convert themselves to humans through some magical process.  My cousin Nedrick does whatever needs doing.  I guess you could check it out for yourself if you're curious.  Anyway, I wonder if you'll bring my cousin, Drithen, this here treat my wife baked up for him special.

1074322	You've demonstrated your strength, got a means of control, and taught the imps to fear you.  You're ready now to summon them.
1074321	That's a well-made whip.  No imp will ignore the sting of that lash.
1074320	*giggle* Mean reapers got fixed!  Pixie friend now! *giggle* When mean thingies bother you, a brave pixie will help.
1074319	*giggle*  Oooh!  For me?
1074318	You need to vanquish an arcane daemon before the imps will fear you properly.
1074317	Well, hurry up.  If you don't get a whip how do you expect to control the little devil?
1074316	Mean reapers are all around trees!  *giggle*  You fix them up, please.
1074315	Arielle wanders quite a bit, so I'm not sure exactly where to find her.  I'm sure she's going to love your gift.
1074314	If you're not up for it, so be it.
1074313	Heh. Changed your mind, eh?
1074312	Maleki's Honor (Juggernaut Set)

1074300	Now that you've shown those mini pests your might, you should collect suitable implements to use to train your summoned pet.  I suggest a stout whip.

1074298	*giggle* Mean reapers make pixies unhappy.  *light-hearted giggle*  You could fix them!

1074291	Hah!  You showed them!
1074290	I think honey and some sparkly beads would please a pixie.
1074289	Surely you're not having difficulties swatting down those annoying pests?
1074288	There's always time to make new friends.
1074287	You're probably right.  They're not worth the effort.
1074286	The children of Sosaria understand the dedication and committment of an arcanist -- and will, from time to time offer their friendship.  If you would forge such a bond, first seek out a goodwill offering to present.  Pixies enjoy sweets and pretty things.
1074285	It is true that a skilled arcanist can summon and dominate an imp to serve at their pleasure.  To do such at thing though, you must master the miserable little fiends utterly by demonstrating your superiority.  Rough them up some -- kill a few.  That will do the trick.

1074276	You press and push on the iron maiden, but nothing happens.
1074275	You are unable to push your way through the tangling roots of the mighty tree.
1074274	You dance in the fairy ring, but nothing happens.
1074273	You must speak with Librarian Verity before you can donate to this collection. 
1074272	You have no way to lower yourself safely into the enormous sinkhole.
1074271	A new follower could not be summoned.
1074270	You have too many followers to summon another one.

1074226	You have not disappointed me.  Enjoy your reward.
1074225	A noble deed you have done this day.  This reward is nothing to a hero such as yourself.
1074224	My ire has been appeased by your efforts.  You are deserving of this reward.
1074223	Have you done it yet?  Oh, I haven’t told you, have I?
1074222	Could I trouble you for some assistance?
1074221	Greetings!  I have a small task for you good traveler. 
1074220	May I call you friend?  I have a favor to beg of you.
1074219	Hello there, can I have a moment of your time?
1074218	Hey!  I want to talk to you, now.
1074217	I want to make you an offer you’d be a fool to  refuse. 
1074216	You there!  Yes you, the simpleton wandering aimlessly.  Come here.
1074215	Don’t test my patience you sniveling worm!
1074214	Knave! Come here right now!
1074213	Hey buddy.  Looking for work?
1074212	*yawn* You busy?
1074211	I could use some help.
1074210	Hi.  Looking for something to do?
1074209	Hey, could you help me out with something? 
1074208	I’d like to speak to an adventurer please. If I can have just a few minutes of your time, I’d like to offer you an exciting opportunity.
1074207	Good day to you friend! Allow me to offer you a fabulous opportunity!  Thrills and adventure await! 
1074206	Excuse me please traveler, might I have a little of your time?
1074205	Oh great adventurer, would you please assist a weak soul in need of aid?
1074204	Greetings seeker.  I have an urgent matter for you, if you are willing. 
1074203	Hello friend. I realize you are busy but if you would be willing to render me a service I can assure you that you will be judiciously renumerated.
1074202	It’s you!   I’m saved, you are just in time.
1074201	Waste not a minute! There’s work to be done. 
1074200	Thank goodness you are here, there’s no time to lose.
1074199	Help! I need somebody! Won’t you please, please help me!
1074198	Might you lend a troubled soul some assistance?
1074197	Pardon me, but if you could spare some time I’d greatly appreciate it.
1074196	Excuse me! I’m sorry to interrupt but I urgently need some assistance. 
1074195	You there, in the stupid hat!   Come here.
1074194	You’re not Drithen! I should have known right away, just look at you. Oh well, you’ll have to do I guess...
1074193	You there! Yes you. Stop looking about like a toadie and come here.
1074192	Ridiculous peasant!  I laugh in your general direction!  You are not up to my challenge!
1074191	Just keep walking away!  I thought so. Coward!  I’ll bite your legs off! 
1074190	*sigh* Oh no. You won’t do at all.  Look at you, so weak, so puny.  Oh no no no. 
1074189	Hey tough guy! I have a job, but I doubt you are up too it.  It requires someone far braver then you.
1074188	Weakling! You are not up to the task I have.
1074187	Want a job?
1074186	Come here, I have a task.
1074185	Hey you! Want to help me out?
1074184	Come here, I have work for you.
1074183	You there! I have a job for you.
1074182	Did you find it?
1074181	Has it been done?
1074180	Do you have them?  Let me see.
1074179	Well enough done.  It's best to kill quickly with respect so there isn't suffering.
1074178	Sap of Sosaria
1074177	*giggle* So pretty!
1074176	Ah, thus it ends.
1074175	Thiiirsty. Hurrr. Hurrr.
1074174	*sniff* fish! much-fish!
1074173	Ah Seeker, I had not thought to see you again in that form.  Perhaps you have difficulty finding the wise Darius?  I do not know where he wanders, but I can tell you that he is always curious, so perhaps you'll find him near a great curiousity?
1074172	Certainly.  There is plenty of time to explore such things.  Return to me should you decide the time is now.
1074171	Ahloestree, friend.
1074170	I will not aid you human, unless you renounce your humanity.
1074169	Suit yourself human.
1074168	Seeker's Symbol
1074167	Well done!  Well done, indeed.  You are worthy to become an arcanist!
1074166	Have you gathered the mushrooms?
1074165	You feel dizzy from a lack of clear air
1074164	An insane dryad comes out of a nearby tree and attacks you!
1074163	You find a way to climb back outside the tree
1074162	You notice a hole in the tree and climb down
1074161	Access to Bedlam by invitation only
1074160	I will take the ears you have collected now.  Hand them here.
1074159	As you open the iron maiden, your surroundings mysteriously change!
1074158	Ah good, you're back.  We're eager for the feast.
1074157	Humans will violate the graves of their own kind? Truly? I would have thought human indencency had some boundaries, but apparently, I am wrong. Prove this is true -- bring to me some human gathered grave dust.
1074156	Here's a task even a human could do. Bring me balls of yarn. Yes, balls of yarn. Even pathetically made human yarn will do, for in the hands of an elf, wonders can be achieved. 
1074155	I require a quantity of horned leather to craft something that will inspire awe, wonder and fear among the sad humans. Hurry, fetch for me this horned leather so that I might shame human craftsmen everywhere!
1074154	Humans lust so terribly for gold. Pathetic really. They barely understand what can be done with the metal. I will demonstrate what elves can craft if you'll bring some of the golden ingots. 
1074153	Valorite is one of the few metals that seems worthy of an elf's attention. With such a metal, I could craft something that would demonstrate the pinnacle of elven superiority! Get me some valorite ingots so I might forge such an item!
1074152	Well, where are the boards?
1074151	Forging a great suit of armor from the scales of a dragon seems an idea worthy of an elf -- so I'm sure these humans have ruined it. Bring me a complete suit of this dragon armor, so I might see all the ways in which humans have done an inferior job of creation.
1074150	Some humans think their no-dachis are impressive swords. I'd rather fight with an elven quill pen in hand! I will show you how clumsy and dull they are if you bring me a few, so that we might mock their inferior workmanship.
1074149	Pathetic, this human craftsmanship! Take their broadswords -- overgrown butter knives, in reality. No, I cannot do them justice -- you must see for yourself. Bring me broadswords and I will demonstrate their feebleness. 
1074148	I doubt very much a human shield would stop a good stout elven arrow. You doubt me? I will show you -- get me some of these heater shields and I will piece them with sharp elven arrows!
1074147	You want to discuss the pathetic qualities of human craftsmanship? How about their bascinet helmets -- weak and flimsy things, your head would be better protect by maple leaves or a bit of straw. I will show you -- bring me some bascinet helmets and I will show you how pathetic they are.
1074146	I understand humans cruely enslave the very wind to their selfish whims! Fancy wind chimes, what a monstrous idea! You must bring me proof of this terrible depredation -- hurry, bring me wind chimes!
1074145	Imagine! A mechanical thing which mocks a man! A golem, what an idea. I am curious about how humans create such a monstrous thing. Perhaps, I can learn more to use it against the devious humans. Go, get me a golem so I might see it more closely. 
1074144	Humans are so pathetically weak, they must be augmented by glass and metal! Imagine such a thing! I must see one of these spyglasses for myself, to understand the pathetic limits of human sight!
1074143	Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?
1074142	Bring me some of these tinker's tools! I am certain, in the hands of an elf, they will fashion objects of ingenuity and delight that will shame all human invention! Hurry, do this quickly and I might deign to show you my skill.
1074141	No self respecting elf female would ever wear a studded bustier! I will prove it -- bring me such clothing and I will show you how ridiculous they are!
1074140	To murder creatures of the forrest for such a ridiculous garment as a fur sarong! It boggles the mind. Perhaps, the skins of the poor animals can be made into a proper garment. Bring me fur sarongs, so I might bring some dignity to the dead creatures.
1074139	Humans call that a fancy shirt? I would wager the ends are frayed, the collar worn, the buttons loosely stitched. Bring me fancy shirts and I will demonstrate the many ways in which they are inferior.
1074138	I do not believe humans are so ridiculous as to wear something called a "kilt". Bring for me some of these kilts, if they truly exist, and I will offer you meager reward.
1074137	Humans do not deserve to wear a thing such as a flower garland. Help me prevent such things from falling into the clumsy hands of humans -- bring me flower garlands!
1074136	I knew humans were treacherous devils. Take the deadly poisons they brew! To be used against who, I wonder? Bring me deadly poison potions, so I might have proof of human's murderous ways.
1074135	The mindless destruction humans cause! They really brew potions of greater conflagration! I must see for myself -- bring me some directly, and I will reward you.
1074134	If humans are going to have explosive potions, we elves must learn more about how they are brewed. I demand you bring some of these bottles of destruction to me right away!
1074133	Humans are so clumsy and stupid, always hurting themselves. I suppose that's why they have healing potions. Hmmm, I wonder what goes into such a concotion? Go and fetch me a sample, so I might investigate.
1074132	Why do humans want to see in the dark? Lurking in shadows to spy on others, that sounds like a human to me! Well, elves can fight fire with fire. Bring me some of these night sight potions and we will even the score.
1074131	I have acquired a barrel of human brewed beer. I am loathe to drink it, but how else to prove how inferior it is? I suppose I shall need a barrel tap to drink. Go, bring me a barrel tap quickly, so I might get this over with.
1074130	The only good thing I can say about human made bottles is that they are empty and may yet still be filled with elven wine. Go now, fetch a number of empty bottles so that I might save them from the fate of carrying human-made wine.
1074129	Do not think it ego when I say elves are superior in all ways. For example, bring a bottle of your wine so that I might gag it down. If you compare it to wonderful elven vintage and you will understand.
1074128	I have sampled human vintage and it has made me deathy ill. I require a cure for such poison. Bring me some cure potions, so I might recover from what humans call "wine".
1074127	Humans take perfectly wonderful grapes and reduce them to the laundry water you call wine! I will show you real elven wine. Bring to me bunches of grapes, so you might know what true craftsmen can achieve.
1074126	You hack the ribcage off of some beast and then eat it? And call that a meal? Absurd! I will not believe it until you bring me an example of these cuts of ribs, so I might see it for myself.
1074125	I am told human-made peach cobbler is a dish worthy of an elf's palate. This, I very much doubt. In fact, I will prove it. Fetch for me some of these peach cobblers and then I will show you a truly magnificent dish!
1074124	I daresay, a human would eat dirt and straw if it were served on a plate. Raw fish and weeds of the ocean? To eat a sushi platter -- what madness! I can scarcely believe it. You must bring for me a sample of such fare, so that I may see for myself. 
1074123	I wish that humans could cook something at least half-way palatable to an elf. But alas, it is all gruel. Though these baked quiches sound promising. I expect they're awful, but you never know. Perhaps, you could bring some for me to try?
1074122	I have tasted human breads and I find them pathetic and lacking. Perhaps, it is the ingredients? Bring for me some of this sweet dough so that I might see how you humans go wrong. Do this and I might show you how real food is created.
1074121	If an elf were to create a piece of furniture, you know it would be a thing of magnificent beauty! I will show you -- bring to me a cherry armoire, what some humans would call a "beautiful" thing. Bring this, and I will point out all the ways in which it is flawed.
1074120	Thread should woven by delicate touch, not so elaborate machine as a spinning wheel. Still, there is something intriguing about the human approach. Bring some spinning wheels, so I might see how inferior thread is created.
1074119	You would lock away all your possessions, fearing thieves everywhere, wouldn't you human? It is folly to put things in your wooden chests, flimsy as they are. I will show you how inferior they are to elven craftsmanship.
1074118	Human fancy knows no bounds!  It's pathetic that they are so weak that they must create a special stool upon which to rest their feet when they recline!  Humans don't have any clue how to live.  Bring me some of these foot stools to examine and I may teach you something worthwhile.
1074117	You think you know something of music? Laughable! Take your lap harp. Crude, indelicate instruments that make a noise not unlike the wailing of a choleric child or a dying cat. I will show you -- bring lap harps, and I will demonstrate.
1074116	More is always better for a human, eh? Take these repeating crossbows. What sort of mind invents such a thing? I must look at it more closely. Bring such a contraption to me and you'll receive a token for your efforts.
1074115	How lazy is man! You cannot even be bothered to pull your own drawstring and hold an arrow ready? You must invent a device to do it for you? I cannot understand, but perhaps if I examine a heavy crossbow for myself, I will see their appeal. Go and bring me such a device and I will repay your meager favor.
1074114	Leave it to a human to try and improve upon perfection. To take a bow and turn it into a mechanical contraption like a crossbow. I wish to see more of this sort of "invention". Fetch for me a crossbow, human.
1074113	Human craftsmanship! Ha! Why, take an elven bow. It will last for a lifetime, never break and always shoot an arrow straight and true. Can't say the same for a human, can you? Bring me some of these human made bows, and I will show you.
1074112	What do humans know of archery? Humans can barely shoot straight. Why, your efforts are absurd. In fact, I will make a wager -- if these so called human arrows I've heard about are really as effective and innovative as human braggarts would have me believe, then I'll trade you something useful.  I might even teach you something of elven craftsmanship.
1074111	I have heard of a strange breed of magic, one that draws its power from the forces of death. This is not the elven way, but I confess my curiosity to understand more. Could you gather for me a quantity of the grave dust used in this necromantic magic?
1074110	Well, where are the cotton bales?
1074109	I cannot help myself human. I see these balls of yarn and I wish to bat them around as if they were prey to be hunted. Please, human, bring me more of these strange and delightful balls of joys. Bring me more yarn!
1074108	Where does one get some of this horned leather, my friend? What are its properties? How difficult is it to work? Ah, perhaps these questions would be more easily answered if you simply brought me some of this horned leather. What do you say human?
1074107	They say men greatly covet metal colored like the fair Sosarian sun. These golden ingot with their mystical properties are of great interest to the elven people. I would be greatly indebted to a human who brough me a supply of golden ingots. 
1074106	Is there a finer metal than valorite? I hear tell of its wonders, but I confess I do not believe the half of it. I must see for myself. Kind human, bring me a supply of this valorite so that I might examine it more closely. 
1074105	Mankind, I am told, knows how to take the scales of a terrible dragon and forge them into powerful armor. Such a feat of craftsmanship! I would give anything to view such a creation -- I would even teach some of the prized secrets of the elven people. 
1074104	There is supposedly a terrible and impressive blade forged by the hand of man. The no-dachi, a sword which requires great smithy skills. I would be honored to view the work of such a mastery human smith. If you can assist me, I would be greatly honored. 
1074103	What would you say is a typical human instrument of war? Is a broadsword a typical example? I wish to see more of such human weapons, so I would gladly trade elven knowledge for human steel. 
1074102	The clank of human iron and steel is strange to elven ears. For instance, the metallic heater shield which human warriors carry into battle. It is odd to an elf, but nevertheless intriguing. Tell me friend, could you bring me such an example of human smithing skill?
1074101	I am curious to see the results of human blacksmithing. To examine the care and quality of a simple item. Perhaps, a simple bascinet helmet? Yes, indeed -- if you could bring to me some bascinet helmets, I would demonstrate my gratitude. 
1074100	To give voice to the passing wind, this is an idea worthy of an elf! Friend, bring me some of the amazing fancy wind chimes so that I may listen to the song of the passing breeze. Do this, and I will share with you treasured elven secrets.
1074099	Is it true human? There are those among your kind who can construct an autonomaton that mocks the shape of a man? It is a frightening but intriguing notion! I must see these golems for myself. Please, bring me a golem and I will reward you with an elven teaching. 
1074098	The wonders of human invention! Turning sand and metal into a far-seeing eye! This is something I must experience for myself. Bring me some of these spyglasses friend human
1074097	Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?
1074096	What a thing, this human need to tinker. It seems there is no end to what might be produced with a set of Tinker's Tools. Who knows what an elf might build with some? Could you obtain some tinker's tools and bring them to me? In exchange, I offer you elven lore and knowledge. 
1074095	It is my understanding, the females of humankind actually wear on certain occasions a studded bustier? This is not simply a fanciful tale? Remarkable! It sounds hideously uncomfortable as well as ludicrously impractical. But perhaps, I simply do not understand the nuances of human clothing. Perhaps, I need to see such a studded bustier for myself?
1074094	Forgive me for saying this, but so much of human clothing is strange to elven eyes. For instance, the fur sarong. I have difficultry believing what I hear, so I must gaze upon it with my own two eyes. Bring some to me and I will happily repay the favor.
1074093	We elves believe that beauty is expressed in all things, including the garments we wear. I wish to understand more about human aesthetics, so please kind traveler -- could you bring to me magnificent examples of human fancy shirts? For my thanks, I could teach you more about the beauty of elven vestements.
1074092	I have heard noble tales of a fine and proud human garment. An article of clothing fit for both man and god alike. It is called a "kilt" I believe? Could you fetch for me some of these kilts so I that I might revel in their majesty and glory?
1074091	Most human apparel is…interesting to elven eyes. But there is one garment -- the flower garland -- which sounds very elven indeed. Could I see how a human crafts such an object of beauty? In exchange, I could share with you the wonders of elven garments.
1074090	Human friend, tell me, is it true there is a dark side to the human art of alchemy? It is troubling to hear such tales -- I feel I must examine the toxins humans produce. Please, bring to me a supply of the deadliest poison humans craft. For this favor, I will grant you precious elven knowledge. 
1074089	The power of a great forrest fire contained in a simple glass container? How remarkable and terrible! I must see for myself. Could you bring for me some of these greater conflagration potions? I will, naturally, reciprocate the favor.
1074088	These alchemy of humans is a wondrous and destructive art! I hear that an "explosive" potion produces a force of fiery potency when used. It sounds fascinating and I would like to see with my own eyes. Are you able to bring me such explosive potions?
1074087	In a perilous world, one can never be too cautious. I understand mankind has developed a potion of healing to cure terrible injuries. I am certain we elves could benefit from this knowledge, so if you bring healing potions to me, I will teach you of elven lore.
1074086	What wonders! A concotion that let's one see in the darkest night! How marvelous! Perhaps, you would obtain for me such night sight potions so that I might banish the darkest from my eyes. 
1074085	Oh, the deviltry! Why would humans lock their precious liquors inside a wooden coffin? I understand I need a "keg tap" to access the golden brew within such a wooden abomination. Perhaps, if you could bring me such a tap, we could share a drink and I could teach you.
1074084	We elves are interested in trading our wines with humans but we understand human usually trade such brew in strange transparent bottles. If you could provide some of these empty glass bottles, I might engage in a bit of elven winemaking
1074083	I understand men are not unfamiliar with the winemaking arts. Does the wine of humans quench thirst like the dew off a morning lily? Perhaps I could see for myself?
1074082	I have discovered through great effort the dread after effects of human wine. My friend, I would be forever in your debt if you provide for me some of these cure potions which removes the efforts of noxious toxins. 
1074081	My friend, perhaps you are interested in elven wine? It is a wondrous elixir but I require a supply of that most precious fruit, a bunch of grapes. Please, bring some to me.<br>
1074080	I desire to try a simple human meal. Something hearty, but simple. Perhaps, a cut of ribs? Yes, that sounds right. Perhaps, if you were to provide this for me, I could instruct you in the ways of elven cooking?
1074079	Humans have a splendid dish I am told, one that harvests the fruits of nature and tastes like drops of the golden sun! A peach cobbler. Such a dish must be priceless, but if you could provide it for me to taste, I would happily teach you more of the elven ways.
1074078	I am told of a speciality dish, a meal of carefully prepared fish. Such a sushi platter must be sublime in its delicacy. I would be eternally grateful if you could provide me with such meal.
1074077	I have heard tales of a potent dish. One that is both strong, yet delicate. Rich, but light. A baked quiche. Such culinary wizardry sounds delightful and I would be very appreciative to one who could provide me with such a meal.
1074076	Such a simple ingredient, yet so versatile! Sweet dough -- what can it not do? I would love to experiment and discover new frontier in the baking arts -- if only I had a supply of this sweet dough. 
1074075	I understand men decorate their living spaces with furniture such as a cherry armoire. It sounds like a beautiful, if strange invention. I would appreciate an opportunity to examine the craftsmanship on such an object.
1074074	The manner by which humans produce cloth is remarkable. A spinning wheel -- how clever! Could you arrange for me to experiement with such a device? 
1074073	Humans have remarkable desire to secure what they "possess". I would be fascinated to see how a human would choose to contain something in a wooden chest. Do you think you could bring me such an item, in exchange for knowledge of elven ways?
1074072	How clever humans are -- to understand the need of feet to rest from time to time!  Imagine creating a special stool just for weary toes.  I would like to examine and learn the secret of their making.  Would you bring me some foot stools to examine?
1074071	Humans artistry can be a remarkable thing. For instance, I have heard of a wonderful instrument which creates the most melodious of music. A lap harp. I would be ever so grateful if I could examine one in person. 
1074070	My friend, I am in search of a device, a instrument of remarkable human ingenuity. It is a repeating crossbow. If you were to obtain such a device, I would gladly reveal to you some of the secrets of elven craftsmanship.
1074069	These human "crossbows" are complex and clever. The "heavy crossbow" is a remarkable instrument of war. I am interested in seeing one up close, if you could arrange for one to make its way to my hands. 
1074068	I have heard of a curious type of bow, you call it a "crossbow". It sounds fascinating and I would very much like to examine one closely. Would you be able to obtain such an instrument for me?
1074067	I wish to try a bow crafted in the human style. Is it possible for you to bring me such a weapon? I would be happy to return this favor.
1074066	We elves are no strangers to archery but I would be interested in learning whether there is anything to learn from the human approach. I would gladly trade you something I have if you could teach me of the deadly crossbow bolt.  
1074065	These human made goods are laughable! It offends so -- I must show you what elven skill is capable of!
1074064	Hurry up! I don't have all day to wait for you to bring what I desire!
1074063	Fine then, I'm shall find another to run my errands then.

1074008	You change your Reward Title to "~1_TITLE~".
1074007	Then you may step forth into history.
1074006	To be born once more an elf, you must strip of all worldly possessions. Nothing of man or beast much touch your skin.
1074005	And now you have returned full circle to the place of your origin within the arms of Mother Sosaria. There is but one thing left to do if you truly wish to embrace your elven heritage. 
1074004	You have carved a path in history, sought to understand the way from our sage companions.
1074003	You yet must perform these services: 
1074002	You have begun to walk the path of reclaiming your heritage, but you have not learned all the lessons before you.
1074001	The most basic lessons of our Sosaria are taught by her humblest children.  Seek Maul, the great bear, who understands instictively the seasons.
1074000	If it is your desire to reclaim your place amongst the people, you must demonstrate that you understand and embrace the responsibilities expected of you as an elf.
1073999	I am glad for your company and wonder if you seek the heritage of your people?  I sense within you an elven bloodline -- the purity of which was lost when our brothers and sisters were exiled here in the Rupture.
1073998	Blessings of Sosaria to you and merry met, friend.

1073989	Shhh!
1073988	Oh welcome back!  Do you have my wax?
1073987	Fine, fine.  Do you have them?
1073986	Hello, hello.
1073985	Greetings!
1073984	The human fascination with death is unsettling but I thank you for your work.
1073983	You have brought fuzzy bundles of delight human! Thank you!
1073982	The dragon armor is most majestic and impressive my friend. Here, I will show you something of elven lore.
1073981	Truly, that is a big sword human. 
1073980	Such a delightful sound, I think I shall never tire of it.
1073979	It is quite the formidable creation. For bringing it to me, I shall show you elven wisdom.
1073978	Enjoy my thanks for your service.
1073977	Now, I shall see what an elf can invent!
1073976	Truly, it is worse than I feared. Still, I appreciate your efforts on my behalf.
1073975	It is not without a certain charm, I suppose. Here, let me teach you of elven garments.
1073974	I say truly -- that is a magnificent garment! You have more than earned a reward.
1073973	I appreciate your service. Now, see what elven hands can create.
1073972	Enjoy my thanks for your service. Perhaps, I can now show you something of the elven arts?
1073971	My thanks for your service.  Here is something for you to enjoy.
1073970	Enjoy my thanks for your service. Prepare for the delights of elven cooking.

1073815	You are already choosing an advanced character template.
1073814	Mystery solved! Enjoy your reward, my friend.
1073813	You've rid the land of an ancient evil. My best wishes, friend.
1073812	The stench of decay subsides, thanks to you.
1073811	You sent those foreign dragons packing, didn't you? My thanks!
1073810	With any luck, those dragons won't be back again!
1073809	You faced the hordes of the underworld and overcame. For that, I will be forever grateful.
1073808	The gargoyle menace has been thwarted. Thank you, traveler.
1073807	Thanks goodness someone thinks of the children. Enjoy this token of our esteem.
1073806	I can only hope these undead stay in their graves once and for all.
1073805	Dragons mean treasure my friend -- enjoy this reward!
1073804	You have performed a noble service. Here, please take this reward.
1073803	Those pale monsters are no more. Enjoy the rewards of the just!
1073802	You have extinguished the gargoyle threat, traveler. Thanks to you.
1073801	Thanks to you for stopping those orcish louts. You deserve this rich reward.
1073800	The shadow of Titans no longer stretches across the land. Thanks to you!
1073799	Mother will appreciate your fine work. Here, don't tell her I gave you this.
1073798	Don't look at me that way. Just take your reward and leave.
1073797	The world will not miss those blubbery brutes. For what you've done, enjoy this reward.
1073796	Sent them back where they belong, eh? Good work.
1073795	I already feel the warmth returning. Accept this reward for killing Ice Fiends!
1073794	It'll be a cold day in you-know-where when you can't kill Artic Ogre Lords, eh?
1073793	For your work against the lava snakes, I have a little something for you.
1073792	You've cleared the stables of evil, my friend! So here are your just rewards!
1073791	Trade is up fifteen percent since you attacked the Sand Vortexes. You've earned a share of the profit.
1073790	There's hasn't been a Kraken attack lately -- congratulations!
1073789	The skies have been clear of drakes lately, so I guess you deserve a reward.
1073788	Ha, the furry wretches' magic was no match for you! A dead ratman mage is worth something, so enjoy!
1073787	Reduced those Golems to component parts? Good, then -- you deserve this reward!
1073786	The Ant Lion infestation seems reduced. Enjoy this reward then.
1073785	With the whipping vines thinned, farmers can get back to work.
1073784	You snapped that cold spell, eh? For facing the Ice Elementals, here's a little something.
1073783	Thinking about those eight legged monsters gives me the chills! Here, take this reward.
1073782	The world is a less magical place, with dead pixies. Good job.
1073781	Ha! Blown away like smoke in the wind, those Efreets are! You earned this reward!
1073780	Tell me, do the Giant Beetles crunch when you kill them? Well, here's your pay.
1073779	Those Gargoyle fanatics won't be troubling anyone any time soon, eh?
1073778	Okay, here's your reward. Now, we never spoke, did we?
1073777	The land appreciates your efforts with the Bog Things. We should have a bumper crop this year!
1073776	We can all rest a little easier with less of those slithery Ophidians about. You've earned this reward.
1073775	Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.
1073774	You have finished your quest and may return for a reward.
1073773	Please, do no rest until those Sphinxes are properly schooled!<br>
1073772	Fight the Ancient Wyrms, please!
1073771	I can still smell the foul decay of Rotting Corpses. 
1073770	You've made a good start but those Serpentine Dragons need to be taught a lesson.
1073769	Reduce a few more Skeletal Wyrms to a pile of bones.
1073768	Balrons cannot be allowed to walk on the earth. Keep fighting them, please!
1073767	There are plenty more Gargoyle Destroyers to, uh, destroy.
1073766	Do the decent thing and kill those horrible succubi!
1073765	Lich Lords still haunt our fair lands.
1073764	Prove you’re a hero -- kill some more Dragons!
1073763	I beseech you, put more Poison Elementals out of their misery.
1073762	The White Wyrms still trouble this land!
1073761	Do not lose hope, you can face more Fire Gargoyles, I am certain.
1073760	There's plenty more Orc Brutes who need killing.
1073759	I hope you haven't had your fill of killing Titans.
1073758	Mum will be disappointed if you don't kill more Terathan Matriarchs.
1073757	What are you looking at? Go kill Elder Gazers!
1073756	Please, continue to battle the Ogre Lords.
1073755	The Daemon hordes still need to be thinned.
1073754	I'm sure you can kill a few more Ice Fiends than that.
1073753	There's more Arctic Ogre Lords to kill, I'm sure of that.
1073752	Those fiery serpents are still too many.
1073751	Don't let the Nightmares or Fire Steeds continue to walk this earth.
1073750	These Sand Vortexes make life impossible!
1073749	Please, help stop the Kraken menace.
1073748	A drake's almost a dragon but I still think you can take 'em.
1073747	I think someone should skin a few ratmen mages, eh?
1073746	The unholy brutes, the Golems, must be smited!
1073745	Please, rid us of the Ant Lion infestation.
1073744	How are farmers supposed to work with these Whipping Vines around?
1073743	The chill won't lift until you eradicate a few Ice Elemenals.
1073742	Dread Spiders? I say keep exterminating the arachnid vermin.
1073741	There's too much cuteness in the world -- kill those pixies!
1073740	Those smoky devils, the Efreets, are still about.
1073739	Did you forget to kill Giant Beetles?
1073738	I won't be able to pay you until you've gotten enough Gargoyle Enforcers.
1073737	There's still too many unicorns around, if you catch my drift.
1073736	Continue to seek and kill the Bog Things.
1073735	Have you killed the Ophidian Knights or Avengers?
1073734	If you decide to return, I'll be waiting here.
1073733	Perhaps you'll change your mind and return at some point.
1073732	Here's a riddle for you. Why hasn't anyone killed those annoying Sphinxes? With their puzzles and enigmatic ways, why we'd be better off without 'em all. In fact, I'll put my money where my mouth is -- kill Sphinxes and I'll reward you well.
1073731	The older a wyrm gets, the more deadly and cunning. The Ancient Wyrms are a treacherous breed, each one soaked in the blood of innocents. A hero needs to right their wrongs, eradicate their evil from fair Britannia.
1073730	Every undead horror was once a living soul. Can you imagine, the poor wretches who become Rotting Corpses? What if some part of them knows what they've become? It's too horrible! Someone should return them to the ground.
1073729	They say the Serpentine Dragons hail from far off lands. Well, that's just wrong. I mean, what, are native dragons supposed to compete with cheap foreign dragons? It's not fair! I think somebody should do something about it!
1073728	Oh, the cruel irony! A hero slays a dragon, only for it to come back as an undead monstrosity thanks to black magic. These Skeletal Wyrms are twice the fiend they ever were in life and it will take twice the hero to put them down again! 
1073727	The Lords of the Underworld have grown bold! They march across the land, terrorizing and rampaging! But without their leaders, the Balrons, the legions of the nether realms aren't nearly the threat. I could reward you handsomely if you could cut the head off of a demon army or two.
1073726	The Gargoyles think they're the superior race! Their Destroyers are the pinnacle of their warriors! But I know, humans are deadlier by far and I'll pay you to prove it to the red-skinned wretches!
1073725	Their girly bits are…exposed! There, out in the open, for any child to see! A succubus is an affront to all decency and morality! Someone needs to stand up for the children! Someone needs to teach the succubi a lesson in decency!
1073724	Death all around us, like a plague of, uh, pestilence! Those undead magicians, the Liches, torment the living! And their masters, the Lich Lords are the worst of the bunch. I'll tell you, I'd give this large treasure pile to anyone who cleared these undead monsters!
1073723	There is no greater foe than the mighty Dragon! A creature of myth and legend! A hero proves his worth by slaughtering the reptillian fiends! What? You're not swayed by my words? Well, would you be interested in a cash reward for killing dragons then?
1073722	Did you know Poison Elementals are corrupted from the very air? They are miserable wretches, cursed by foul magic. You do them a favor by destroying the noxious creatures -- they'd surely thank you, though you might not notice it for them trying to kill you. But, I could find it in my heart to reward you for killing poison elementals.
1073721	Beware the White Wyrm, my friend! They are not a beast to be trifled with. I've seen them gut villages and swallow peasants whole! My hatred for the albino atrocities runs deep -- so deep, I'd give all that I own to rid the land of them. 
1073720	Does it seem uncommonly warm here? I think it does. I've seen Fire Gargoyles nearby. Those burning wretches turn to ash everything they touch. Do you know what does for property values? Do us all a favor and fight fire with fire -- kill some Fire Gargoyles for me.
1073719	You've probably slain your fair share of the common orc, eh? Orcs are a dime a dozen, but the Orc Brute -- that's a different story entirely! They're hideous monsters who've earned their deaths a dozen times over! How about giving the lumpen oafs the death they so richly deserve?
1073718	To live among giants is no easy task my friend. Take these Titans. Their appetites are prodigious, indeed. They consume all in their path trying to placate their enormous hunger! It leaves precious little for us to feed ourselves. I may not be wealthy, but if someone could kill a few Titans, I could afford to be generous with them.
1073717	My dear old mum, she does hate those awful Terathan. She'd like nothing better than to wreck their hives. Hmm, you know -- kill a Terathan Matriarch and the hive drops in efficiency. I wonder…perhaps someone who targeted a few Terathan Matriarchs would do some damage to the Hive. That'd sure make my old mum proud....
1073716	They watching me! Shh! They might hear! They've had their eyes on me for a while -- no, I'm not paranoid! Have you seen the way they look at me? Elder Gazers, indeed! Why do they observe me so? Please, kind traveler -- kill the fiends! Close their never-blinking eyes once and for all and I will gladly reward you!
1073715	Corpulent foul-smelling brutes! Without their leaders, your average ogre is such a menace. But as long as the Ogre Lords are around, they whip that unsightly rabble into shape. Hmm, makes you think we should target a few of these Orge Lords, doesn't it?
1073714	From the Stygian depths, the Daemons rise to torment poor humankind! I've seen them, cutting a swath of destruction through our fair land. But you, you seem a hardy adventurous sort. Perhaps you have experience in slaying foul daemons?
1073713	Devils of snow and ice! They steal the warmth from our very souls! If only someone were brave enough to face the dread Ice Fiends and reduce their numbers, then decent folk might have a chance for once!
1073712	Those frosty brutes! It's impossible to make a decent bonfire with them about! I'm talking about those masters of ice magic, the Arctic Ogre Lords. Yes, I'd certainly add a few coins to the purse of anyone tough enough to turn a few of those brutes into ice cubes!
1073711	You've heard of a snake in the grass? How about a serpent in a lava field? Those fiery monsters cause no end of trouble, slithering and burning. Find a way to turn a few lava serpents into charcoal and I'll make sure you leave with a heavy purse.
1073710	These demon horses mock the bond between rider and steed! It pains me to see such despicable monsters in the shape of a noble horse. Please, execute these unholy mockeries, the Nightmares or the Fire Steeds, for me -- do this, and I will gladly reward you.
1073709	I have a business proposition for you, my friend. Caravans would like to move freely across our fair deserts except the accursed Sand Vortexes always attack them. If you could, say "disenchant" a few Vortexes, I could compensate you for your efforts in encouraging free trade. 
1073708	From the foul depths, the Kraken come to torment men. The scaly horrors make life near impossible for us all. I know it may not be much, but I'd gladly reward any who were fearless enough to face the Kraken and reduce their host!
1073707	The flap of their leathery wings, the scratch of their reptillian claws, the clank of their scales. Keep your eyes open, friend for there are Drakes in these parts. The unwary find themselves a hot meal for the cold blooded fiends. I'd give all the treasure I possess to anyone brave enough to scourge a number of those devils from our fair skies.
1073706	It baffles me how a Ratman can be smart enough to learn magic. But, I don't think they're so smart you couldn't kill a few. The beady-eyed fiends have been causing trouble in these parts, so I'd be glad to reward someone who thinned their numbers.
1073705	They're unholy, I say. Golems, a walking mockery of all life, born of blackest magic. They're not truly alive, so destroying them isn't a crime, it's a service. A service I will gladly pay for.
1073704	Ants are industrious and Lions are noble so who'd think an Ant Lion would be such a problem? The Ant Lions have been causing mindless destruction in these parts. I suppose it's just how ants are. But I need you to help eliminate the infestation. Would you be willing to help for a bit of reward?<br>
1073703	I should be trimming back the vegetation here, but something nasty has taken root. Vicious vines I can't go near. If there's any hope of getting things under control, some one's going to need to destroy a few of those Whipping Vines. Someone strong and fast and tough. 
1073702	Feel that chill in the air? It means an icy death for the unwary, for deadly Ice Elementals are about. Who knows what magic summoned them, what's important now is getting rid of them. I don't have much, but I'll give all I can if you'd only stop the cold-hearted monsters.
1073701	They aren't called Dread Spiders because they're fluffy and cuddly now, are they? No, there's nothing appealing about those wretches so I sure wouldn't lose any sleep if you were to exterminate a few. I'd even part with a generous amount of gold, I would.
1073700	Is there anything more foul than a pixie? They have cruel eyes and a mind for mischief, I say. I don't care if some think they're cute -- I say kill them and let the Avatar sort them out. In fact, if you were to kill a few pixies, I'd make sure you had a few coins to rub together, if you get my meaning.
1073699	If I had but one wish, it would be to rid myself of these dread Efreet! Fire and ash, they are cunning and deadly! You look a brave soul --would you be interested in earning a rich reward for slaughtering a few of the smoky devils?
1073698	You think you've seen destruction and horror, my friend? You haven't seen anything until you've seen what a Giant Beetle can do to a nicely tilled garden. There's been a swarm of 'em lately. I don't have much, but if you could rid the area of a few, I'm sure I could find something to reward you with.
1073697	It is regretable that the Gargoyles insist upon warring with us. Their Enforcers attack men on sight, despite all efforts at reason. To help maintain order in this region, I have been authorized to encourage bounty hunters to reduce their numbers. Eradicate their number and I will reward you handsomely.
1073696	Psst. Listen close my friend, for I'll not speak of this again. Unicorns. You know them, I know them. I need a number of them gone. Don't ask why something you beautiful needs to be destroyed. If you can manage the task, I have the means to reward you handsomely. 
1073695	There's been a bumper crop of evil with the Bog Things in these parts, my friend. Though they are foul creatures, they are also most fecund. Slay one and you make the land more fertile. Even better, slay several and I will give you whatever coin I can spare.

1073621	Your reward has been placed in your backpack.
1073620	You have not learned this recipe.
1073619	You've restored the natural balance friend and earned this generous reward.<br>
1073618	I think Giant Ice Worms are a myth, don't you? Shh, I don't want to talk about it -- just take the money and be gone.
1073617	Did you seem them run around? Wasn't that great? Here, take this reward -- that’s the most fun I've had in days.<br>
1073616	Yes, I like these woods much better without the trees wandering about. Nice job. <br>
1073615	Hmm, looks like you've built the better rat-trap. Enjoy a little reward then!<br>
1073614	I no longer feel their prying gaze of evil upon me. For that, I give thanks to you -- here's is your reward.<br>
1073613	It's fascinating to watch the nest in action, isn't it? Here's something for your trouble.<br>
1073612	You've brought a measure of peace to this area. Please, accept this meager offering as reward.<br>
1073611	Mmm. Smells like dead orc, out there! Nicely turned! Fatten your purse with this, then!<br>
1073610	Pleace accept this modest offer for your bravery in facing those undead sorcerers.<br>
1073609	I haven't seen a single web since you cleared the area. You've more than earned this.<br>
1073608	My friend, take this reward for your work in driving back the Terathan hive.<br>
1073607	Oh, I hope those little buggers are burning where you sent 'em! Here's a little something to fill out your purse.<br>
1073606	The spirits are now at peace. Please, take this as a reward for your work.<br>
1073605	You've done a noble deed, putting these undead down. I only wish I could give you a greater reward than this.<br>
1073604	Well, you're turned them rocky horrors into gravel, didn't you? You've got my thanks -- and this reward.<br>
1073603	Nice work. Now, here's something for your trouble -- and this will stay between you and me, right?<br>
1073602	Well, I don't feel any luckier, but there's sure a lot less bogglings about. Good job, my friend.<br>
1073601	Finally, some peace and quiet! You've more than earned this reward.
1073600	Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.
1073599	Four of each, that's all I ask. Water, earth and fire. <br>
1073598	You wouldn't try and just pretend you murdered 10 Giant Ice Worms, would you?<br>
1073597	Dead Solen Queens isn't too much to ask, is it?
1073596	I'm thinking of building a small shed and the lumber of 15 reapers would be just about right.<br>
1073595	I don't see 10 tails from Ratman Archers on your belt -- and until I do, no reward for you.<br>
1073594	Have you annihilated a dozen Gazers yet, kind traveler?<br>
1073593	I don't think you've gotten their attention yet -- you need to kill at least 10 Solen Warriors.<br>
1073592	The Brigands still plague us. Have you killed 20 of their number?<br>
1073591	The only good orc is a dead orc -- and 4 dead Captains and 6 dead Bombers is even better!<br>
1073590	Surely, a brave soul like yourself can kill 10 Bone Magi and Skeletal Mages?<br>
1073589	You've got a good start, but to stop the black-eyed fiends, you need to kill a dozen. <br>
1073588	Unless you kill at least 10 Terathan Warriors, you won't have any impact on their hive.<br>
1073587	Don't let the little devils scare you! You  kill 12 imps -- then we'll talk reward.<br>
1073586	The restless spirts still walk -- you must kill 15 of them.
1073585	Your task is not done. Continue putting the Skeleton and Bone Knights to rest.<br>
1073584	You got rocks in your head? I said to kill 12 earth elementals, okay?<br>
1073583	Uh, I don't think you're quite done killing Mummies yet. <br>
1073582	Go back and kill all 20 bogglings!
1073581	Until you kill 12 Wailing Banshees, there will be no peace. 
1073580	I hope you'll reconsider. Until then, farwell.
1073579	The universe is all about balance my friend. Tip one end, you must balance the other. That's why I must ask you to kill not just one kind of elemental, but three kinds. Snuff out some Fire, douse a few Water, and crush some Earth elementals and I'll pay you for your trouble.
1073578	It makes no sense! Cold blooded serpents cannot live in the ice! It's a biological impossibility! They are an abomination against reason! Please, I beg you -- kill them! Make them disappear for me! Do this and I will reward you. 
1073577	Were you the sort of child that enjoyed knocking over anthills? Well, perhaps you'd like to try something a little bigger? There's a Solen nest nearby and I bet if you killed a queen or two, it would be quite the sight to behold.  I'd even pay to see that -- what do you say? 
1073576	The woods in these parts are restless. Wrathful trees, walking about. Why, they're a menace to decent folk! And I'm running low on firewood, so what do you say? Could you turn a few reapers into some useful lumber?
1073575	Vermin! They get into everything! I told the boy to leave out some poisoned cheese -- and they shot him. What else can I do? Unless…these ratmen are skilled with a bow, but I'd lay a wager you're better, eh? Could you skin a few of the wretches for me?
1073574	Kind traveler, hear my plea. You know of the evil orbs? The wrathful eyes? Some call them gazers? They must be a nest nearby, for they are tormenting us poor folk. We need to drive back their numbers. But we are not strong enough to face such horrors ourselves, we need a true hero. 
1073573	A Solen hive is a fascinating piece of ecology. It's put together like a finely crafted clock. Who knows what happens if you remove something? So let's find out. Exterminate a few of the warriors and I'll make it worth your while.
1073572	Thank goodness, a hero like you has arrived! Brigands have descended upon this area like locusts, stealing and looting where ever they go. We need someone to put these vile curs where they belong -- in their graves. Are you up to the task? 
1073571	Foul brutes! No one loves an orc, but some of them are worse than the rest. Their Captains and their Bombers, for instance, they're the worst of the lot. Kill a few of those, and the rest are just a rabble. Exterminate a few of them and you'll make the world a sunnier place, don't you know. 
1073570	Why must the dead plague the living? With their foul necromancy and dark sorceries, the undead menace the countryside. I fear what will happen if no one is strong enough to face these nightmare sorcerers and thin their numbers.
1073569	I've seen them hiding in their webs among the woods. Glassy eyes, spindly legs, poisonous fangs. Monsters, I say! Deadly horrors, these black widows. Someone must exterminate the abominations! If only I could find a worthy hero for such a task, then I could give them this considerable reward.
1073568	The Terathan are an aggressive species. Left unchecked, they will swarm across our lands. And where will that leave us? Compost in the hive, that's what! Stop them, stop them cold my friend. Kill their warriors and you'll check their movement, that is certain.
1073567	Imps! Do you hear me? Imps! They're everywhere! They're in everything! Oh, don't be fooled by their size -- they vicious little devils! Half-sized evil incarnate, they are! Somebody needs to send them back to where they came from, if you know what I mean. 
1073566	It is a piteous thing when the dead continue to walk the earth. Restless spirits are known to inhabit these parts, taking the lives of unwary travelers. It is about time a hero put the dead back in their graves. I'm sure such a hero would be justly rewarded.
1073565	Please, hear me kind traveler. You know when a knight falls, sometimes they are cursed to roam the earth as undead mockeries of their former glory? That is too grim a fate for even any knight to suffer! Please, put them out of their misery. I will offer you what payment I can if you will end the torment of these undead wretches. 
1073564	You want to hear about trouble? I got trouble. How's angry piles of granite walking around for trouble? Maybe they don't like the mining, maybe it's the farming. I don't know. All I know is someone's got to turn them back to potting soil. And it'd be worth a pretty penny to the soul that does it.
1073563	Nobody told me about the Mummy's Curse. How was I supposed to know you shouldn't disturb the tombs? Oh, sure, now all I hear about is the curse of the vengeful dead. I'll tell you what -- make a few of these mummies go away and we'll keep this between you and me.
1073562	Some say killing a boggling brings good luck. I don't place much stock in old wives' tales, but I can say a few dead bogglings would certainly be lucky for me! Help me out and I can reward you for your efforts. 
1073561	Can you hear them? The never-ending howling? The incessant wailing? These banshees, they never cease! Never! They haunt my nights. Please, I beg you -- will you silence them? I would be ever so grateful.

1073337	...her smile seemed full of teeth sharper than a human ought to have, for the tale of orcish raising had struck fear into the marrow of my bones.
1073336	He had sandy hair like thee, and I dreamt as a child of holding his hand and sharing flavored ice. His name was Japheth.
1073335	'Twas a fearful run, and I came to the road to Yew with welts and scratches run rampant crost my skin, but I did not see her again.
1073334	Oft have I wondered of the boy named Japheth, and whether he remembers a girl who lived in sandstone walls.
1073333	Her provenance, she told me over nights illuminated by campfires, was once the city of Trinsic.
1073332	Her name was Leyla, she said, and her hair was braided wild with creepers and thorns.
1073331	Some have speculated that what we are analyzing is in fact nothing more than the very air crackling near the wisp's glow, and not language, but this is of course unlikely.
1073330	Wisps do make use of what sounds to us like pitch and emphasis shifts similar to exclamations and questions.
1073329	The average word in wispish seems to consist of three phonemes and three glottal stops, plus possibly a pitch shift.

1073322	Oft one encounters the deadly exploding toadstool; the ones in Deceit are deadlier than most, as they explode continually.

1073318	Be wary of a brazier that giveth warning when approached: thou canst use it to summon deadly creatures.
1073317	Library Friends - Quotes from the pen of Mercenary Justin
1073316	Hence my basic advice to those who seek to tame a dragon-be sure that thou hast mastered the twin skills of taming animals, and running away very fast.
1073315	I never did discover the exact cause of this strange behavior except to assume that it was not typical for this reptilian species.
1073314	...the dragon suddenly whirled as if in a panic, ran a short distance, took off into the air, then transformed into a whirlwind. 
1073313	The sole time I approached one with an eye towards taming it, my initial attempts at calming it met with failure.
1073312	The fireball was massive enough to light a city I should surmise.
1073311	I have not much to tell about dragons.

1073308	Suddenly the shutters blew open, and Lord British fell to the ground, one hand shileding his eyes.
1073307	We must bring the shards into harmony, so that they resonate in such a manner that matches the original universe.
1073306	But I am but a mouse, and none hear me.
1073305	Even pawns have lives and loves at home, my lord.
1073304	Yet sometimes one must sacrifice a pawn to save a king.
1073303	Aid the nobility that resideth in human heart.
1073302	A shard of a universe is a powerful thing.
1073301	Oft have I wished that stranger would return.

1073038	The cavern, located deep beneath the Nujel'm Palace, was discovered by Lord Graye Denthe.
1073037	Welcome to the Prism of Light Cavern Exhibit.
1073036	I bet you can't handle ten plague spawns!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073035	A gorilla once bit my sister.  No, really.  So, I'm on a crusade to have the filthy beasts destroyed once and for all.  Kill eight of them and I'll make it worth your while.
1073034	Disgusting!  The way they scuttle on those hairy legs just makes me want to gag.  I hate spiders and anything like them!  Rid the world of twelve terathan drones and I'll reward you.
1073033	I imagine you don't know about the mongbats.  Well, you may think you do, but I know more than just about anyone.  You see they come in two varieties ... the stronger and the weaker.  Either way, they're a menace.  Exterminate ten of the weaker ones and four of the stronger and I'll pay you an honest wage.
1073032	I admire them, you know.  The solen have their place -- regimented, organized.  They're fascinating to watch with their constant strife between red and black.  I can't help but want to stir things up from time to time.  And that's where you come in.  Kill either twelve red or twelve black solen workers and let's see what happens next!
1073031	Have you ever seen what a slime can do to good gear?  Well, it's not pretty, let me tell you!  If you take on my task to destroy twelve of them, bear that in mind.  They'll corrode your equipment faster than anything.
1073030	A pity really.  With the balance of nature awry, we have no choice but to accept the responsibility of making it all right.  It's all a part of the circle of life, after all. So, yes, the grizzly bears are running rampant. There are far too many in the region.  Will you shoulder your obligations as a higher life form?<br>
1073029	You've got to help me out! Those ratmen have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  I'll pay you if you kill off twelve of those dirty rats.<br>
1073028	You've got to help me out! Those dire wolves have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  They run around in a pack of around ten.<br>
1073027	It's a big job but you look to be just the adventurer to do it!  I'm so glad you came by ... I'm paying well for the death of six giant ice serpents and six frost spiders.  Hop to it, if you're so inclined.<br>
1073026	You've got to help me out! Those wild ostards have been causing absolute havok around here.  Kill them off before they destroy my land.  There are around twelve of them.
1073025	I bet you can't tangle with those bloodsuckers ... say around ten vampire bats!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073024	I bet you can't tangle with those nasty plants ... say eight corpsers and two swamp tentacles!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073023	I bet you can't kill ... ten gibberlings!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073022	I bet you can't kill ... ten harpies!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073021	I bet you can't kill ... ten gore fiends!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... <br>
1073020	I bet you can't kill ... say twelve ... flesh golems!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... <br>
1073019	Hahahaha!  I knew it!
1073018	I bet you can't kill ... say ten ... lava lizards!  I bet they're too much for you.  You may as well confess you can't ... 
1073017	It's a big job but you look to be just the adventurer to do it!  I'm so glad you came by ... I'm paying well for the death of five ogres and five ettins.  Hop to it, if you're so inclined.
1073016	Disgusting!  The way they scuttle on those hairy legs just makes me want to gag.  I hate spiders!  Rid the world of twelve and I'll find something nice to give you in thanks.
1073015	Those green-skinned freaks have run off with more of my livestock.  I want an orc scout killed for each sheep I lost and an orc for each chicken.  So that's four orc scouts and eight orcs I'll pay you to slay.
1073014	They may not be bright, but they're incredibly destructive.  Kill off ten trolls and I'll consider it a favor done for me.
1073013	You can't trust them, you know.  Lizardmen I mean.  They have forked tongues ... and you know what that means.  Exterminate ten of them and I'll reward you.
1073012	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill twelve ghouls.
1073011	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill eight patchwork skeletons.
1073010	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill ten skeletal mounts.
1073009	Why?  I ask you why?  They walk around after they're put in the ground.  It's just wrong in so many ways.  Put them to proper rest, I beg you.  I'll find some way to pay you for the kindness. Just kill five zombies and five skeletons.

1072982	Examine the contract for the name and location of the intended victim.
1072981	Or perhaps you'd rather not.
1072980	The Black Order's fortress home is well hidden.  Legend has it that a humble fishing village disguises the magical portal.
1072979	As you wish.
1072978	Examine the package for the name and location of its rightful owner.
1072977	Of course, you could also choose to keep the bundle.
1072976	I don't know where inside The Citadel such evidence could be found.  Perhaps the most guarded sanctum is the place to look.
1072975	Many fear to tangle with the wicked sorceress.  I understand and appreciate your concerns.
1072974	Once you gain entrance into The Citadel, you will need to move cautiously to find the sect leaders.
1072973	I do not fault your decision.
1072972	*whisper* The Citadel entrance is disguised as a fishing village.  The magical portal into the stronghold itself is moved frequently.  You'll need to search for it.
1072971	*whisper* It's a very dangerous task.  Let me know if you change your mind.
1072970	You have discovered a contracted agreement of assassination.  Perhaps the individual named in the contract would pay gladly for the document?
1072969	The Serpent's Fang sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human and elf.
1072968	The Tiger's Claw sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human and elf.
1072967	I wish to make a statement of censure against the elite ninjas of the Black Order.  Deliver, in the strongest manner, my disdain.  But do not make war on women, even those that take arms against you.  It is not ... fitting.
1072966	The Dragon's Flame sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human or elf.  Either race will do, I care not for the shape of their ears.  Yes, this action will properly make clear my disapproval and has a pleasing harmony.
1072965	You have discovered a bundle of stolen property.  Will you return it to its rightful owner?
1072964	We believe the Black Order has fallen under the sway of Minax, somehow.  Seek evidence that proves our theory by piercing the secrets of the Citadel.
1072963	I have a task for you ... adventurer.  Will you risk all to win great renown?  The Black Order is organized into three sects, each with their own speciality.  The Dragon's Flame serves the will of the Grand Mage, the Tiger's Claw answers to the Master Thief, and the Serpent's Fang kills at the direction of the High Executioner.  Slay all three and you will strike the order a devastating blow!
1072962	What's that? *alarmed gasp*  Do not speak of the Black Order so loudly, they might hear and take offense.  *whispers*  I collect the badges of their sects, if you wish to seek them out and slay them.  Bring five of each and I will reward you.

1072780	You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.  Unnatural creatures, brought to a sort of perverted life, despoil our fair world.  Destroy them -- 5 Exodus Overseers and 2 Exodus Minions.
1072779	Every moment you procrastinate, these unnatural creatures damage Sosaria.
1072778	Why do you delay?  The human blight must be averted.
1072777	Where are the items you've been tasked to supply for the feast?
1072776	The requirements are simple -- 250 boards.
1072775	I care not where you acquire the cotton, merely that you provide it.
1072774	The mushrooms I seek can be found growing here in The Heartwood. Seek them out and gather them.  You are running out of time.
1072773	You waste my time.  The task is simple. Kill 50 rats in an hour.
1072772	Spellweaving Skill.
1072771	You must serve Sosaria with all your heart and strength.  Your unwillingness does not reflect favorably upon you.
1072770	Do not falter now.  You have begun to show promise.
1072769	The people have need of these items.  You are proving yourself inadequate to the demands of a member of this community.
1072768	You endanger your progress along the path with your unwillingness.
1072767	*nods* Not everyone has the temperment to undertake the way of the Arcanist.
1072766	You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.  The human vermin that have spread as a disease, despoiling the land are the greatest blight we face.  Kill humans and return to me the proof of your actions. Bring me 30 human ears.
1072765	With health and defense assured, we need look to the need of the community for food and drink.  We will feast on fish steaks, sweets, and wine.  You will supply the ingredients, the cooks will prepare the meal.  As a Arcanist relies upon others to build focus and lend their power to her workings, the community needs the effort of all to survive.
1072764	We must look to the defense of our people!  Bring boards for new arrows.
1072763	The way of the Arcanist involves cooperation with others and a strong committment to the community of your people.  We have run low on the cotton we use to pack wounds and our people have need.  Bring 10 bales of cotton to me.
1072762	Learning to weave spells and control the forces of nature requires sacrifice, discipline, focus, and an unwavering dedication to Sosaria herself.  We do not teach the unworthy.  They do not comprehend the lessons nor the dedication required.  If you would walk the path of the Arcanist, then you must do as I require without hesitation or question.  Your first task is to gather miniature mushrooms ... 20 of them from the branches of our mighty home.  I give you one hour to complete the task.
1072761	Learning to weave spells and control the forces of nature requires sacrifice, discipline, focus, and an unwavering dedication to Sosaria herself.  We do not teach the unworthy.

1072749	Friends of the Library Membership Token.
1072748	There you are!  *pleased smile*  Don't you just love when a form is all filled in like that?  All of the sections are complete, everything is neat and tidy and the official seal is perfectly formed and in exactly the right spot.  It's comforting.  Here you are.  All you need to do now is return the form to Librarian Verity.  Have a nice day!
1072747	Hello, hello.  No rush of course.  I'm sure Sarakki is patient and doesn't mind waiting for the wax.

1072740	An arcane focus appears in your backpack.
1072739	You hear a click behind the wall.
1072738	Dragon Smithing
1072737	The sickening crunch under your feet alerts you of another trap filled with murderous fiends.
1072736	The Serpent's Fang Sect leaps from the shadows with their blades drawn!
1072735	From the dark corners spring the Claw of the Tiger.
1072734	The floor crackles beneath your feet, alerting the protectors. The Flame of the Dragon is upon you!
1072733	The air suddenly stirs around you. From the darkness you feel the sting of the Serpent's Fang!
1072732	Your presence here has not gone unnoticed. Citadel protectors spring forth from the shadows!
1072731	Your foot brushes against a wire, tripping a hidden trap!
1072730	The manor lord is unavailable. Please use the teleporter on your right.
1072729	Hello, hello!  Speckled, that's what they are.  All covered with spots and speckles when you look very closely.  Speckled scorpion poison sacs will do the trick.
1072728	I see. I see.  Well good luck to you.
1072727	What's this?  Sealing wax ... Sarakki ... official documents ... Oh, I see.  Can do, can do.  You will need to get me the poison sacs of course.  They are so volatile they aren't viable after an hour or so ... yes, yes.  Right, well off you go, speckled scorpions are the only critters that have the right poison.  They live in the desert near here.
1072726	Petrus lives in Ilshenar, past the Compassion gate and beyond the gypsy camp.
1072725	I do apologize for being unprepared. Perhaps when you return later I'll have more wax in stock.
1072724	What do you have there?  Oh.  *look of dismay*  It seems everyone is interested in helping the library -- but no one warned me to stock up on sealing wax.  I'm afraid I'm out of the mixture we use to notarize offical documents.  There will be a delay ... unless you'd like to take matters into your own hands and retrieve more for me from Petrus?
1072723	Access to the Stacks
1072722	*glare*  Shhhh!  You need to visit the notary.  She can be found near the castle.
1072721	Hrmph!
1072720	Shhh!  *angry whisper*  This is a library, not some bawdy house!  If you wish to become a friend of the library you'll learn to moderate your volume.  And, of course, you'll take this application and have it notarized by Sarakki the Notary.  Until you've become an official friend of the library, I can't allow you to make donations.  It wouldn't be proper.

1072715	Those titans don't skulk very well.  You should be able to track them easily ... their footsteps are easily the largest around.
1072714	Certainly.  You've done enough to merit a breather.  When you're ready for more, report back to me.
1072713	The ogre insurgency has taken a turn for the worse!  I've just been advised that the titans have concluded their discussions with the ogres and they've allied.  We have virtually no information about titans.  Engage them and appraise their mettle.
1072712	Make sure you fully assess all of the cyclopian tactical abilities!
1072711	Oh, I see.  *sigh*  Perhaps I overestimated your abilities.
1072710	Inconceiveable!  We've learned that the ogre leadership has recruited some heavy-duty guards to their cause.  I've never personally fought a cyclopian warrior, but I'm sure you could easily best a few and report back how much trouble they'll cause to our growing community?
1072709	Ogre Lords are pretty easy to recognize.  They're the ones ordering the other ogres about in a lordly manner.  Striking down their leadership will throw the ogres into confusion and dismay!
1072708	Reluctance doesn't become a hero like you.  But, as you wish.
1072707	*sigh*  We have so much to do to clean this area up.  Even the fine work you did on those ogres didn't have much of an impact on the community.  It's the ogre lords that direct the actions of the other ogres, let's strike at the leaders and perhaps that will thwart the miserable curs.

1072702	I know that this is a lot to ask.  Thank you for hearing my request.
1072701	Ah my friend, thank you again for your timely aid!  The ring is finally complete and I'm ready to reveal to Ciala my love for her.  Would you ... could you present her with my token?
1072700	The stolen ring is easy enough to recognize.  It has an inscription on it declaring my love for Ciala.  Please find this token of love for me!
1072699	Please, I beg of you, reconsider!
1072698	Argh!  I knew those ratmen were up to no good!  They have stolen the ring I was making for my beloved Ciala.  The sparkle must have caught their greedy eyes.  Find the ring please!  I beg you.
1072697	When you were exterminating those untidy vermin, you must have noticed the archers amongst them?  Those cowardly rats have been peppering us with arrows and then running away before we can retaliate.  Can I count on you to handle this for me?
1072696	The unblessed failed.  Make sure there is room in your pack for the deed.

1072686	What a miserable place we live in.  Look around you at the changes we've wrought. The trees are sprouting leaves once more and the grass is reclaiming the blood-soaked soil.  Who would have imagined we'd find ourselves here?  Our "neighbors" are anything but friendly and those ogres are the worst of the lot.  Maybe you'd be interested in helping our community by disposing of some of our least amiable neighbors?
1072685	The ratmen have holes all over the place that lead to their warrens.  Sometimes they're loitering around on the surface too.  Either way, they're not hard to find.
1072684	I understand.  The stench in those tunnels is unbearable.
1072683	~1_NAME~ has already activated the Prism, please wait...

1072607	I'm just a house pet!
1072606	I want a cracker!
1072605	Loot and plunder!  Loot and plunder!
1072604	Arrrr, matey!
1072603	Wind in the sails!  Wind in the sails!
1072602	I just flew in from ~1_CITYNAME~ and boy are my wings tired!
1072601	Don't make me into a feathered hat!
1072600	Shiver me timbers!
1072599	Thank thee for the cracker!
1072598	Hail!
1072597	You have found a white pearl!
1072596	That showed them!
1072595	Those blasted gargoyles hang around the old tower.  That's the best place to hunt them down.
1072594	Don't tell me you're a gargoyle sympathizer?  *spits*
1072593	Those gargoyles need to get knocked down a peg or two, if you ask me.  They're always flying over here and lobbing things at us.  What a nuisance.  Drop a dozen of them for me, would you?
1072592	You are very kind.  Thank you.
1072591	Whoever this "Dallid" might be, he's probably looking for his bucket.
1072590	You're right, who cares if Dallid might pay for his battered old bucket back.  This way you can carry it around with you!
1072589	The battered, old bucket is inscribed with barely legible writing that indicates it belongs to someone named "Dallid".  Maybe they'd pay for its return?
1072588	You haven't lost the letter have you?  It must be delivered to Ahie directly.  Give it into no other hands.
1072587	*looks disappointed* Let me know if you change your mind.
1072586	You cannot cast Ethereal Voyage while you are in combat.
1072585	*looks around nervously*  Do you travel to The Heartwood?  I have an urgent letter that must be delivered there in the next 30 minutes -- to Ahie the Cloth Weaver.  Will you undertake this journey?  
1072584	A strongbox.
1072583	A bag of treasure.
1072582	Amazing!  Simply astonishing ... you survived.  Well, I supposed I should indulge your avarice with a reward.
1072581	Hahahaha!  I can see the fear in your eyes.  Pathetic.  Szavetra is waiting for you.
1072580	TEMP: You have cast Ethereal Voyage.
1072579	Hah!  I knew you couldn't handle it.
1072578	Hmm, maybe you aren't entirely worthless.  I suspect a demoness of Szavetra's calibre will tear you apart ...  We might as well find out.  Kill the succubus, yada yada, and you'll be richly rewarded. 
1072577	It's about time!  Could you have taken longer?
1072576	How difficult is this?  The rats live in the tunnels.  Go into the tunnels and find the biggest, meanest rat and execute him.  Loitering around here won't get the task done.
1072575	Alright, if you'd rather not, then run along and do whatever worthless things you do when I'm not giving you direction.
1072574	Well now that Moug-Guur is no more -- and I can't say I'm weeping for his demise -- it's time for the ratmen to experience a similar loss of leadership.  Slay Chiikkaha.  In return, I'll satisfy your greed temporarily.
1072573	You're better than I thought you'd be.  Not particularly bad, but not entirely inept.
1072572	Small words.  Kill Moug-Guur.  Go.  Now!
1072571	Fine. It's no skin off my teeth.
1072570	You have found an Ecru Citrine!
1072569	You have found a blackrock!

1072562	You have found a flawless diamond!
1072561	You there!  Yes, you.  Kill Moug-Guur, the leader of the orcs in this depressing place, and I'll make it worth your while.
1072560	Leader of the Pack
1072559	You have fallen prey to an ambush!
1072558	The crystal patterns shift dramatically!
1072557	Electricity builds up around the crystal patterns. Something is changing.
1072556	Lenley so happy!  Lenley not get dead.  You have best Lenley shiny!
1072555	You have successfully escorted Lenley to safety!  Don't forget to collect your reward from him.
1072554	Lenley not run away yet.  Go, go, Lenley not past pig-men orcs.  You go, Lenley go after you.  Go!
1072553	You no like Lenley? No hurt Lenley!  No see Lenley.  Go 'way.
1072552	Lenley isn't seen.  Why you see me? Lenley is sneaking.  Lenley runs away.  You help Lenley to not get dead?  We go out past pig-men orcs?  Yes? Yes? You say yes?
1072551	You found a brilliant amber!
1072550	You found a luminescent fungi!

1072524	You repair the golem.

1072274	The acrid air is poisonous!
1072273	You've completed a quest!  Don't forget to collect your reward.
1072272	Thanks for helping me out.  Here's the reward I promised you.
1072271	You're not quite done yet.  Get back to work!
1072270	Well, okay. But if you decide you are up for it after all, c'mon back and see me.
1072269	Quest Giver
1072268	A small bag of trinkets.
1072267	I just can't bear it any longer.  Sure, it's my job to thin the deer out so they don't overeat the area and starve themselves come winter time.  Sure, I know we killed off the predators that would do this naturally so now we have to make up for it.  But they're so graceful and innocent.  I just can't do it.  Will you?
1072266	An arrow imbeds itself into your flesh!
1072265	Mighty creatures they are, aye.  Fierce and strong, can't blame 'em for wanting to feed themselves an' all.  Blame or no, they're eating all the fish up, so they got to go.  Lend a hand?
1072264	Chirp chirp ... tweet chirp.  Tra la la.  Bloody birds and their blasted noise.  I've tried everything but they just won't stop that infernal clamor.  Return me to blessed silence and I'll make it worth your while.
1072263	Psst!  Hey ... psst!  Listen, I need some help here but it's gotta be hush hush.  I don't want THEM to know I'm onto them.  They watch me.  I've seen them, but they don't know that I know what I know.  You know?  Anyway, I need you to scare them off by killing a few of them.  That'll send a clear message that I won't suffer goats watching me! 
1072262	Pork is the fruit of the land!  You can barbeque it, boil it, bake it, sautee it.  There's pork kebabs, pork creole, pork gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried.  There's apple pork, peppered pork, pork soup, pork salad, pork and potatoes, pork burger, pork sandwich, pork stew, pork chops, pork loins, shredded pork.  So, let's get some piggies butchered!
1072261	Mmm, I do love mutton!  It's slaughtering time again and my usual hirelings haven't turned up.  I've arranged for a butcher to come by and cut everything up but the basic sheep killing part I haven't gotten worked out yet.  Are you up for the task?
1072260	A pity really.  With the balance of nature awry, we have no choice but to accept the responsibility of making it all right.  It's all a part of the circle of life, after all. So, yes, the boars are running rampant. There are far too many in the region.  Will you shoulder your obligations as a higher life form?
1072259	Aaaahhhh!  They're everywhere!  Aaaaahhh!  Ahem.  Actually, friend, how do you feel about rabbits?  Well, we're being overrun by them.  We're finding fuzzy bunnies everywhere. Aaaaahhh!
1072258	You failed to complete an objective in time!
1072257	Are you new around here?  Well, nevermind that.  You look ready for adventure, I can see the gleam of glory in your eyes!  Nothing is more valiant, more noble, more praiseworthy than mongbat slaying.
1072256	Elf
1072255	Human
1072254	You there! Yes, you.  Listen, I've got a little problem on my hands, but a brave, bold hero like yourself should find it a snap to solve.  Bottom line -- we need some of the bulls in the area culled.  You're welcome to any meat or hides, and of course, I'll give you a nice reward.
1072253	They're everywhere I tell you!  They crawl in the walls, they scurry in the bushes.  Disgusting critters.  Say ... I don't suppose you're up for some sewer rat killing?  Sewer rats now, not any other kind of squeaker will do.

1072057	For the duration of this spell, the caster’s damaging spells and healing spells are increased in effectiveness. Summoned creatures and animated undead are also increased in effectiveness.
1072056	Death during this spell effect can possibly be reversed for the arcanist, or a bonded pet under the control of the arcanist.
1072055	This spell can possibly slay any one creature (never a player) that is under 5-30% of its maximum health.  Player characters and creatures that are not slain outright take chaos damage instead.
1072054	Allows the arcanist to wander around in an ethereal form as if under the effects of monster ignore.  Effect ends after the duration expires or when the caster performs a hostile action (whichever comes first). The arcanist is still visible to other player characters and may be attacked by other player characters as normal. Cannot be used during the heat of battle.
1072053	The arcanist may assume a dryad's allure and charm humanoids (but not players) to temporarily serve their will.
1072052	A blast of cold air that inflicts cold damage to all enemies within its area of effect. Enemies attack and cast spells slower while under this spell’s chill effect. Chill effect lasts for several seconds.
1072051	A blast of intense heat that distributes fire damage to all opponents within its area of effect. Lasts for several seconds.
1072050	Transforms the caster into a reaper that provides bonuses to swing speed, spell damage, and resists. However, while in this form, the caster is susceptible to Fire and moves at a slower speed.
1072049	Summons a lesser fiend to fight, follow, and guard the arcanist.
1072048	Summons a lesser fey to fight, follow, and guard the arcanist.
1072047	Summons a swarm of insects that inflict poison damage upon its victim. The more it is angered, the more damage it inflicts.
1072046	A thunderous boom that temporarily smites opponents with energy damage and possibly reduces spellcasting recovery time.
1072045	The arcanist attunes their life force, granting them a temporary ability to absorb physical damage.
1072044	Temporarily enchants a melee weapon to inflict extra fire damage per hit.
1072043	The arcanist taps into the regenerative forces of nature to deliver healing pulses for the duration of the spell.
1072042	The caster and up to four participating arcanists (all within 20 spellweaving skill of each other) must stand inside an arcane circle, pentagram or abbatoir. When the caster invokes this spell, a magically charged emerald (called an arcane focus) is created for the caster and each participating arcanist. The arcane focus increases duration, spell damage, healing spell effectiveness, and area of effect for the activator’s Spellweaving spells.

1071221	Oh, I beg your pardon! I am Lyla, assistant to the Zoologist Iakas. I'm searching for samples from the gelatinous family of slimes - such an amazing species! - for him. They have some monetary value as well, as they excrete a pigment that can be used as a dye. Yet I can't even seem to catch one! They're moving so... well, I've never seen anything like it. If you think you can do better, would you collect three samples and deliver them to Iakas as the Royal Britannian Zoo? Use these basins - they can hold the slime safely.

He pauses for a moment before speaking to you:</i> <BR><BR>Jedah was once one of my most promising students, but her greed will be her downfall. <BR><BR>I will send one of my disciples to deal with her later. It is more important to get that sword back first. <BR><BR>I’m counting on you to find it. She would have kept it close to her. Take the White Teleporter, located in my backyard, and check inside boxes and chests around the treasure room of the inn and return it to me when you find it.<BR><BR>Be very careful. Jedah was an expert with traps and no doubt she’s protecting the sword with them. <BR><BR>If you find a trap, try timing it and you may be able to avoid damage. <BR><BR>I’ve provided you with several heal potions in case you become injured. <BR><BR>In the bag you will also find more clothing appropriate to your new found profession. <BR><BR>Please return the sword to me. I implore you not to take anything else that may be hidden in the Inn. <BR><BR>Thank you.
1063198	You stand on the strange floor tile but nothing happens.
1063197	Go back through the blue teleporter and tell Daimyo Emino what you’ve overheard.
1063196	You quietly approach the door and see a woman named Jedah Entille speaking to a shady figure in dark clothing. You move closer so you can overhear the conversation. Fortunately, your entrance did not alert the preoccupied party. <BR><BR>Jedah’s brash voice permeates the air:<I><BR><BR> Now that it is hidden, we’ll hide out here until Daimyo Emino forgets about us. Once he realizes his beloved sword is missing, he’ll surely start looking for the thieves. We will be long gone by that time. </I><BR><BR>After overhearing the conversation, you understand why you were sent on this trial. You must immediately tell Daimyo Emino what you have learned.
1063195	Must have been strong ale to land me in this place.
1063194	Who locked me in this room?
1063193	I wonder if I can find a sharpening stone around here.
1063192	Ah, a quiet hideout.
1063191	They won’t find me here.
1063190	Take the Blue Teleporter Tile from Daimyo Emino's house to the Abandoned Inn. Quietly look around to gain information.
1063189	<I>Zoel quickly grabs the scroll from your hand and reads the note:</i> <BR><BR>Still alive then? You’ll have to impress me further before I will give my approval of you to Daimyo Emino. <BR><BR>You must return to the inn and begin the next trial. <BR><BR>We believe an associate has, shall we say, inadvertently negated our contract. <BR><BR>Find out what information you can and return to Daimyo Emino with the news. And be careful not to lose your head.<BR><BR>The Blue Teleporter Tile in Daimyo Emino’s residence will lead you to your fate. I suggest you hurry. <BR><BR>...And take care to tread softly. There is no greater traitor than a heavy footfall upon a path.
1063188	You decide against dropping this important note.

1063184	<I>Daimyo Emino smiles as you approach him:</I> <BR><BR>I see that you have survived both the first trial and Zoel’s temper. <BR><BR>For that you have been rewarded with Leggings and Gloves befitting your occupation. The material is the only armor a <b><I>True Ninja</i></b> needs. <BR><BR>You have yet to prove yourself fully, young hireling. Another trial must be met. Off to Zoel you go.

1063177	<I>Zoel studies your face as you approach him. Wryly, he says:</I><BR><BR> Daimyo Emino has sent another already? The stains from the last have not yet dried! <BR><BR>No matter, we’ll finish you off and clean it all at once, eh? <BR><BR>Now to the point, your only task is to survive in the abandoned inn.<BR><BR>You will be instructed when you need to act and when you should return to one of us. <BR><BR>Only a true Ninja is deft enough to finish and remain alive.<BR><BR>Your future... or your demise... lies in this cave beyond. <BR><BR>Now go.

1062924	<body>Strange items from a strange land are being found. Rumors abound of a new land with new warriors and new ways to wage war. If the rumors are true, Britannia might never be the same. This strange helm was brought back on a trade vessel. Its exotic beauty pales in the face of its durability.</body>
1062923	Ancient Samurai Helm
1062922	<body>The fifth age, known as the Age of Shadows, was a difficult one. Necromancers had learned to raise the dead from their graves, and holy Paladins joined ranks to wipe the dark art of Necromancy from the world. It is a struggle that still continues. Paladins, thanks to a blacksmith with arcane knowledge, now have the Holy Sword to help in their quest.</body>
1062921	The Holy Sword
1062920	<body>When Lord Blackthorn waged a dark campaign to steal control of Britannia, the citizens often stayed home at night, not daring to leave their homes. The good people of Britannia spent those cold nights huddled around the warmth of a blazing fireplace like this one.</body>
1062919	Hearth of the Home Fire
1062918	<body>The history of the world is recorded in this tapestry, starting with the first days of Britannia to Third Dawn’s age of prosperity and opportunity. It was designed by one of Lord British’s most loyal companions, Iolo, a master bard and storyteller.</body>
1062917	The Tapestry of Sosaria
1062916	<body>Once a king of Sosaria, Shamino was one of Lord British’s greatest Companions. Hailing from the city of Skara Brae, known for its spiritual people, Shamino followed the life of a ranger and was perhaps the best marksman in the land. This crossbow design is one created especially for him by Iolo, his long-time companion.</body>
1062915	Shamino’s Best Crossbow
1062914	<body>In the second age of Britannia, the peaceful town of Trinsic was attacked by the forces of chaos. After a fierce, bloody battle, the town was overrun and destroyed. This rose commemorates the Honor of the Trinsic defenders.</body>
1062913	Rose of Trinsic
1062912	<body>When Britannia was founded, the king was attacked with a fire spell that nearly killed him. (Rumors of his demise were highly exaggerated.) Ever since, he kept a pair of Royal Leggings of Embers nearby.</body>

1062200	A personal bless deed has been placed in your backpack.
1062199	Dirt lots are a special type of house that can be <a href = "?143">customized</a>.  They are in most respects exactly like normal houses, except that only players who have upgraded to Ultima Online: Age of Shadows can own them.  There are three ways to obtain a dirt lot:  by <a href = "?135">placing</a> one, by <a href = "?140">buying</a> one, or by <a href = "?141">converting</a> a house into one.
1062198	DIRT LOTS
1062197	This feature allows you to create a truly unique home by laying out the floor plan and choosing building materials for the walls, floors, and other components.  In order to build or own a custom house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online: Age of Shadows</I>.  Not all houses are customizable.  In order to build your own house, you need to obtain a customizable <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a> and sufficient <a href = "?167">funds</a> to pay for the customization.  Using your house sign, you will enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a> and edit your house's design.  When you are ready, you can <a href = "?165">commit</a> your new design, making it visible for all the world to see.
1062196	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062195	personal bless deed for ~1_NAME~
1062194	Vendors and barkeepers are invisible when they are inside a <a href = "?170">moving crate</a>.  In order to put them back to work, you must move to the desired location in your house.  Next, open the context-sensitive menu on your avatar and choose the Station Vendor option.  A menu listing all your vendors and barkeeps by name appears.  Select one.  If the place you are standing on is valid, the vendor or barkeep appears there and returns to work.
1062193	UNPACKING VENDORS AND BARKEEPS
1062192	When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, items inside your <a href = "?170">moving crate</a> remain inside and hidden.  You must remove these items and position them in your house.  Vendors and barkeeps require <a href = "?172">special handling</a>.<BR><BR>The moving crate cannot be picked up, and you cannot put items inside.  Once you remove an item from the crate, you cannot put it back in.  Items inside the crate count toward your secure storage limit.  Items inside your moving crate are organized into sub-containers.<BR><BR>You can teleport your moving crate to the spot where you are standing at any time by opening your house sign menu, going to the CUSTOMIZATION page, and choosing <B>Relocate Moving Crate</B>.
1062191	UNPACKING
1062190	The house moving crate is a special container that holds your locked down items, secure containers, vendors, barkeepers, and house add-ons while you edit your house.  When you enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a>, your items are packed into the moving crate, which is hidden from view.<BR><BR>If you leave customization mode without committing a new design, your items are automatically unpacked from the moving mrate and restored to their previous position.  The only exception is house add-ons, which remain in deed form inside the moving crate.  You must manually replace these.<BR><BR>When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new design, items cannot be automatically unpacked from the moving crate.  You must instead <a href = "?171">unpack</a> these items yourself.
1062189	MOVING CRATE
1062188	In Customization Mode, all access to the house is blocked except to the person customizing the house.  In this mode, all other players see the house as it was prior to entering customization mode, but hey cannot enter it or interact with it in any way.  The player actually customizing the house, however, can see and edit a new in-progress design.  When you are customizing a house, you are invisible and safe from attack.  You can walk through the walls of your house and walk on air without falling.  This allows you to change your house design conveniently and in perfect safety.  Note, however, that you cannot do anything else at all in this mode.  While customizing your house, you cannot open your backpack, use any objects, use any skills, speak to other players, or leave the house.  It is much like being a ghost.  See also: <a href = "?168">normal mode</a>.
1062187	CUSTOMIZATION MODE
1062186	In normal mode, customizable houses behave just like any other house -- you can walk around on them or in them, store objects inside, and so forth.  See also:  <a href = "?169">customization mode</a>.
1062185	NORMAL MODE
1062184	The cost to commit a house design is based on the number of components in the house, including the foundation itself.  The current cost of a house is displayed in the lower-right corner of the house design menu.  When committing a new design, you are refunded 90% of the value of the old design and must pay the cost displayed.
1062183	CUSTOMIZATION COSTS
1062182	Non-customizable houses have fixed costs.  The cost to place each house type is displayed on the house placement tool menu.  If you demolish a non-customizable house or covert it into a customizable one, you are refunded 90% of this amount (also referred to as the house value).
1062181	HOUSE VALUE
1062180	Once you are completed re-designing your house, you are ready to commit the design.  In order to do so, you must have funds in your bank (in the form of gold and/or checks) to cover the <a href = "?167">cost</a> of your new design.  (Note that if your new design has fewer components in it, you may receive a refund.)  Simply open the <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> in the <a href = "?145">house customization interface</a> and choose the <a href = "?XXX">Commit</a> option.  Once your confirm, your house will change to your new design.  Once you do this, you must check over the security settings on all your <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.
1062179	COMMITTING A NEW HOUSE DESIGN
1062178	If you are not ready to <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, you can save it for later.  To do this, simply right-click the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  You will exit <a href = "?169">customization mode</a> and you can come back and work on your design again later.
1062177	SAVING A DESIGN
1062176	Your custom house design must (to a certain degree) obey the laws of physics.  This means that you can't have floors floating on air and hovering columns.  Every <a href = "?146">component</a> in your house must be structurally supported.  Most components provide some form of structural support to other components.<BR><BR>Here is how it works:  There are two main types of structural support:  floors and walls.  Any tile in your house design that does not have valid structural support highlights orange.  You cannot <a href = "?165">commit</a> your house design while any tiles in it are not validly supported.<BR><BR><a href = "?158">Floor (and <a href = "?161">teleporter</a>) tiles must be supported by non-floor components on the story below.  Floor tiles on the first story of your house are considered supported by the foundation below them.  Any <a href = "?173">wall</a>, <a href = "?159">door</a>, or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> component that is the full height of one story of your house can provide structural support for floor components above them.  Any floor tile directly on top of a supporting component is itself considered supported.  Any floor tile adjacent to a directly supported floor tile is also supported.  If you build a solid line of floor tiles between two directly supported tiles, all tiles in that line are validly supported.  Whenever you form a rectangle of supported floor tiles, all floor tiles in that rectangle are validly supported.<BR><BR>Non-floor components must obtain their structural support either from validly supported floors, or from adjacent non-floor items.  Any component that touches the ground can receive its support from a floor tile.  Some components (like parts of archways) do not touch the ground, and can only receive support from an adjacent component that is tall enough.  There is a limit to how far pieces can receive adjacent support.
1062175	STRUCTURAL SUPPORT
1062174	To edit a different story of your house, use the buttons in the rightmost column on your house customization interface.  Each button corresponds to one story of your house.  Simply click a button to be transported to that story.  When you do this, <a href = "?174">transparency settings</a> for all stories are reset.
1062173	STORY SELECTION
1062172	These controls allow you to change the visibility of walls and floors on different stories of the house, to make it easer to design around them.  Each of the buttons in this column correspond to one story of your house.  Each time you click the button, transparency settings move to the next setting in the cycle.  When you <a href = "?175">change stories</a>, all transparency settings are reset on all storied.
1062171	TRANSPARENCY SELECTION
1062170	The miscellaneous <a href = "?146">component</a> category contains a selection of different tiles, including archways, battlements, columns, fences, and waterfalls.  Like most other components, these require <a href = "?163">structural support</a> and can provide structural support to other components.
1062169	MISCELLANEOUS
1062168	Teleporter <a href = "?146">components</a> are a type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  They are similar in most respects to <a href = "?158">floor</a> components, except that they provide an alternative means to move around in your custom house.<BR><BR>In order for a teleporter to be functional, it must link to one or more other teleporters.  Each teleporter component has a different symbol engraved in it.  To link teleporters, place multiple teleporters of the same symbol.  When you <a href = "?152">commit</a> your design, teleporters with matching symbols link up.<BR><BR>Stepping on one linked teleporter will move your avatar to another teleporter tile with the same symbol.  If there are only two teleporters in your house with the same symbol, stepping on one will always move you to the other.  If three or more teleporters share the same symbol, stepping on one will move you to one of the others with the same symbol, selected randomly.
1062167	TELEPORTERS
1062166	Stair <a href = "?146">components</a> come in two types.  First are staircases, which serve to join different stories of your house.  The other type are front steps, which allow access to your foundation.  On the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> for the stairs category, staircases appear on the top row and front step components appear on the bottom row.<BR><BR>Staircases are multiple-tile components that have special properties.  They must have sufficient <a href = "?163">structural support</a>.  Furthermore, you cannot place <a href = "?158">floors</a> in the spaces above a staircase, because those floors would block movement up the staircase.<BR><BR>Front steps can only be placed along the south edge of your house's foundation.  Note that the house customization system will allow you to <a href = "?155">erase</a> all of your front steps.  If you do this, it will be impossible for anyone (including you) to enter your custom house.  Be careful to always create a way to get onto your house!
1062165	STAIRS
1062164	Door <a href = "?146">components</a> are one type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  Simply choose the style of door from the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> you wish to paint on your house design.  Like <a href = "?173">walls</a>, doors require<a href = "?163"> structural support</a>, and can provide support for items above them.
1062163	DOORS
1062162	Floor <a href = "?146">components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  Select the floor you wish to paint onto your house design.  If you wish to change floors that are hidden by walls, use the <a href = "?174">transparency buttons</a> to see behind them.  Floors provide <a href = "?163">structural support</a> for non-floor components positioned on top of them.
1062161	FLOORS
1062160	<a href = "?146">Components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  They are organized according to how they should be positioned in your house.  Use the V-shaped corner piece when two walls should to the south and east.  The smallest pieces here are the corner posts that join walls to the north and west.  The remaining wall pieces are north and east facing walls.  With a little practice, you'll get a good feel for how these pieces connect together.  Walls must be <a href = "?163">structurally supported</a> and if they are full-height they can provide support for floor components above them.<BR><BR>You may use the window toggle at the top of the component menu to select walls with built-in windows to place in your house design.
1062159	WALLS
1062158	On the left side of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu are nine buttons organized in three rows of three.  The first two rows open lists of components you can paint onto your house design.  To choose a component to paint, click the desired category and then select a component from the <a href = "?146">component menu.<B><B>The available categories of components are: <a href = "?173">Walls, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>.
1062157	COMPONENT SELECTION
1062156	These numbers near the bottom of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> display the number of components and number of fixtures in your house design.  Hovering your mouse over this counter brings up a small window showing more details.<BR><BR>Each fixture also counts as a component.  Fixtures are components that are interactive, and currently include <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.  Fixtures also count towards your house secure storage limit.  The number of fixtures allowed in a house design is limited.
1062155	COMPONENT AND FIXTURE COUNTER
1062154	The eraser tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to delete <a href = "?146">components</a> from your house design.  To erase components from your house design, click the Erase icon and target tiles to delete.  The tile to be deleted highlights red when your cursor is over it.  Click to erase the tile.  You cannot click and drag to delete multiple components.  You must single-click once for each tile to be deleted.
1062153	ERASER
1062152	The eyedropper tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to instantly select a <a href = "?146">component</a> already in your house design.  Click the Eraser icon, and target the component to copy.  The component menu switches to the page where the selected component can be found, and your cursor switches to painting mode with that component active.
1062151	EYEDROPPER
1062150	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to replace your in-progress house design</a> with your current active design.  This is much like <a href = "?151">restoring</a> a design, except you are loading the last design you <a href = "?152">committed</a> rather than the last design you <a href = "?150">backed up</a>.
1062149	REVERT
1062148	The Commit button is located in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  Click this button to finalize your in-progress design and make it your house's active design.  See <a href = "?165">committing a new house design</a> for more information.
1062147	COMMIT
1062146	Click the Restore button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to restore a previously <a href = "?150">backed up,</a> house design.  This does not affect your house's active design.
1062145	RESTORE
1062144	Click the Backup button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to create a backup of your in-progress design.  Whenever you leave design mode without committing your new design, your in-progress design is automatically backedup.  Your house can only have one backed up design, so using this option overwrites your previous backup.  Use the <a href = "?151">restore</a> button to load your backed up design into your in-progress design.
1062143	BACKUP
1062142	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to simply erase your current design and start over.  Click the Clear button on the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> to erase your current design and start over with an empty dirt lot.  Note that this only clears your current in-progress design, and does not erase your active design or your <a href = "?150">saved</a> design.
1062141	CLEAR
1062140	While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, network conditions may cause your client to lose synchronization with the server.  Use this <a href = "?147">system menu</a> button to force a re-synchronization.  This completely resets your client's view of your house design to match the one on the server.
1062139	SYNCH
1062138	The system menu button in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> shows several icons that allow you to change house modes and access additional features.  The buttons are:<BR><BR><a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>.
1062137	SYSTEM MENU
1062136	The center area of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> is where you select components to paint onto your house design.  Most <a href = "?157">categories</a> of components have multiple pages of items to choose from.  The arrow icons on the left and right edges of this menu allow you to switch between pages of available components.  From this menu, click a component, and you will enter paint mode with the selected component active.<BR><BR>When entering the <a href = "?173">walls</a> or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> categories, this area first shows a one-page list of subcategories.  Click a subcategory to browse the individual sets of components in that category.  When browsing a subcategory, an upward pointing arrow icon here allows you to return to the category list.<BR><BR>When in the walls category, this menu has an extra button that toggles windows on and off.  If you wish to place walls with built-in windows, click the window toggle.<BR><BR>In the <a href = "?159">doors</a> category, icons next to each door show which way the door opens.
1062135	COMPONENT MENU
1062134	Customizable houses have two modes: <a href = "?168">normal</a> and <a href = "?169">customization</a>.<BR><BR>When you enter Customization Mode, all of the house's contents are either ejected or packed into a <a href = "?170">Moving Crate</a>.  As you customize your house, no objects, players, or monsters can interact with you or the house.  You can leave customization mode by <a href = "?165">committing a new design</a>, or by <a href = "?164">saving your design for later</a>.  Committing a new design costs you money and requires you to manuall unpack the moving crate.  Saving a design for later restores the house to its former state.<BR><BR>Custom houses must obey certain <a href = "?163">structural support</a> rules.<BR><BR>While customizing a house, a special house building interface appears on your screen.

1062133	HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION
1062132	You are limited to owning one house on your account across all shards.  If you own a house on one shard, you cannot own a house on another shard.  If at any time you place a new house or receive a house in trade, your house will become condemned.  A condemned house will decay within 5 days.  The only way to un-condemn a house is to trade it to another player.  If you trade away your new house, this will <B>not</B> un-condemn your other house.<BR><BR>Whenever you place a house or receive on in trade with another player, you may not place another house or receive another house in trade for seven days, even if you demolish the house or trade it to another player.<BR><BR>In order to own a <a href = "?143?">customizable</a> house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online:  Age of Shadows</I>.  If your account is not upgraded, you cannot place a customizable <a href = "?144?">dirt lot</a>, nor can you receive a customizable house in trade.
1062131	HOUSE RESTRICTIONS
1062130	If you have a static non-customizable house, it may be possible to convert it into a <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a>.  The following house types <B>cannot</B> be converted:  Castles, Keeps, Two-Story Wood and Plaster, and Two-Story Stone and Plaster.  All other house types can be converted.  When you convert a house into a dirt lot, the house vanishes and is replaced with a dirt lot exactly the same size as the original house.  This conversion is completely secure and automatic, so there is no risk of losing your house.  If you meet the <a href = "?139">restrictions</a> for owning a customizable dirt lot, you may perform the conversion using your house sign menu.<BR><BR>When you convert the house, you are refunded the original purchase price of the house, then charged the cost of the equivalent dirt lot.  In most cases, the original cost of a house is more than the cost of a dirt lot with the same footprint, meaning you will get a refund (which can be used towards customizing your lot).  Note that "original purchase price" refers to the cost of the deed used to place the house, or the cost listed on the House Placement Tool menu for the house, and <B>not</B> the amount the house was traded for in its last player-to-player trade.
1062129	HOUSE CONVERSION
1062128	You can buy a house from another player or sell a house to another player, using the standard Trade Window.  It is not possible to exchange houses this way.  In order to have a house traded to you, you must meet all house <a href = "?139">ownership restrictions</a>.  If you do, then it is possible for the house owner to open a trade window containing a house trade scroll.  For this to happen, both you and the house owner must be outside the house and standing within two paces of the house sign.  You both must remain within 2 tiles of the house sign or the trade will fail.  The trade scroll shows the name of the house owner, the name of the house, and the sextant coordinates of the house.  This scroll is also a distinctive ice-blue color that cannot be faked.  <B>Be sure to verify you are buying the correct house!</B>  Once both parties double-check the trade and agree to it, the house is transferred.
1062127	HOUSE TRADING
1062126	<B>Ownership Restrictions:  </B>You may only <a href = "?135">place</a> or be <a href = "?140">traded</a> a house once every 7 days.  You may only own one house on your account.  If you place or receive a second house, any other house(s) on your account, across all shards, will become <a href = "?97">condemned</a>.
1062125	OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS
1062124	<B>Other Houses:</B>  When <a href = "?135">placing a new house</a>, remember that no two houses can be adjacent in the east/west direction -- there must be an unobstructed path at least one tile wide between any two houses.  Also, there is a five-tile buffer zone to the north and south of a house that must remain clear of all other houses.  Finally, you cannot place a house whose corner is adjacent diagonally to the corner of another house.
1062123	OTHER HOUSES
1062122	<B>Terrain:</B>  Houses can only be <a href = "?135">built</a> on level terrain that is free of obstruction.  The entire plot of land that your new house will rest on must all be completely flat.  Furthermore, the house's foundation and front steps cannot rest on any obstruction, or be adjacent to any obstruction.  An obstruction is considered to be a part of the landscape that a player cannot walk over.  Obstructions may exist <B>under</B> the house, so long as they are not tall enough to poke up through the floor of the house.  It must be possible to walk all the way around the house staying adjacent to its walls or front steps, without being blocked by anything on the terrain.
1062121	TERRAIN
1062120	<B>Locations:</B>  <a href = "?135" >House placement</a> is not allowed within the boundaries of any town or other region protected by guards.  Housing is also not allowed near any dungeon entrance or shrine.  The area known as the Lost Lands, and the entire facet of Ilshenar are also not suitable for housing.  Finally, some areas have been reserved for other reasons.  When you try to place in these illegal locations, you will be informed that housing is not allowed there.
1062119	LOCATIONS
1062118	You can create a house by using a <B>house placement tool</B>.  This device can be purchased from an Architect NPC in many towns across the land.  The tool itself is inexpensive, but in order to place a house you will need to have sufficient funds in your bank box to pay for it.  In addition to the tool and funds, you must also have an open spot of land outside of town that is level and free of obstructions.  If you have found such a spot, then double-click your House Placement Tool and choose the type of house to place from the menu.  Next, you will see a ghosted image of the selected house on your targeting cursor.  Position the ghosted house and click to try to place it.  If placement fails, you will be notified as to the reason, and you can try again.  There are several important rules about house placement, which are detailed in the paragraphs following: <a href = "?136">Location</a>, <a href = "?137">Terrain</a>, <a href = "?138">Other Houses</a>, <a href = "?139">Ownership Restrictions</a>.

This action will not un-condemn any other houses on your account, nor will it end your 7-day waiting period (if it applies to you).  Are you sure you wish to continue?

1060225	Paladins are the holy warriors of the realm who have dedicated themselves as protectors of the virtues and vanquishers of all that is evil.<BR><BR>Paladins have several special abilities that are not available to the ordinary warrior. Due to the spiritual nature of these abilities, the Paladin requires some amount of mana to activate them. In addition to mana, the Paladin is also required to spend a certain amount of tithing points each time a special ability is used.<BR><BR>Tithing points and mana are automatically consumed when a special Paladin ability is activated. All Paladin abilities are activated through the <I>Book of Chivalry</I>
1060224	The Paladin has many special abilities he can call forth through the use of his <I>Book of Chivalry</I>.<BR><BR>The Book Of Chivalry can be thought of as the Paladin's spell book.  To use an ability, simply open the Book of Chivalry to the appropriate page and double click the icon of the ability you wish to activate<BR><BR>The following abilities are available to the Paladin at various points of his development:<BR><BR>* Cleanse by Fire<BR>* Close Wounds<BR>* Consecreate Weapon<BR>* Dispel Evil<BR>* Divine Fury<BR>* Enemy of One<BR>* Holy Light<BR>* Noble Sacrifice<BR>* Remove Curse<BR>* Sacred Journey
1060223	Players may tithe gold to the Virtue Shrines by opening the context sensitive menu interface on the shrine's Ankh.  There they may choose the <a href="?ForceTopic109">Tithe Gold</a> option, which will bring up the Tithing Interface.  The Tithing Interface lists the amount of gold the player is currently holding.  The player may then use the four arrows to convert Gold into Tithing points and vice versa.<BR><BR>When the <I>OK</I> button is clicked, the player's tithed Gold will be converted into the listed amount of Tithing Points.
1060222	Tithing points are gained by tithing gold to the Virtue Shrines.  A Paladin who tithes gold to the shrine is making manifest his devotion to the concepts and beliefs that the Shrines exemplify.<BR><BR>Once gained through an act of tithing, these 'points' may be used by the Paladin to summon the divine abilities granted to his class.<BR><BR>Each use of a Paladin Ability consumes Tithing Points in addition to the pure energy of Mana.
1060221	The Paladin ability <I>Sacred Journey</I> mimics the mage spell of <I>Recall</I> almost exactly, in that it allows a Paladin to instantly travel to any location for which he has a marked recall rune.<BR><BR>The Paladin cannot take a <I>Sacred Journey</I> if he is targeting or is being targeted by any creature, or is in combat. 
1060220	The Paladin’s <I>Remove Curse</I> ability allows him to remove all <I>Curse</I> type effects from a single target.  Curses include all Necromancer curses, as well as the spells Feeblemind, Clumsy, Weaken, and Paralyze.
1060219	The Paladin’s <I>Noble Sacrifice</I> ability allows him to sacrifice himself for the greater good of those in the area.  When the ability is used, the Paladin is taken down to one (1) Hit Point, one (1) Stamina, and one (1) Mana.<BR><BR>In response to the Paladin's sacrifice, all of the dead in the affected area are offered resurrection, while all of the living are Cured and Healed.
1060218	The Paladin’s <I>Holy Light</I> ability is the only direct-damage ability that the Paladin possesses.  Calling on the powers of his faith, he may call forth a magnificent beacon of holy light which damages all enemies in a small radius around the caster.
1060217	The <I>Enemy of One</I> Paladin ability causes the <I>next</I> creature the Paladin strikes to become his “mortal enemy”.  For the duration of the effect, whenever the Paladin strikes a creature that is his sworn “mortal enemy”, his damage is greatly increased.<BR><BR>Because the Paladin is so completely focused on a specific enemy type, however, all other creature types will have their damage against the Paladin increased when they strike him.
1060216	Your shot was successful
1060215	The Paladin’s <I>Divine Fury</I> ability allows him to wage a raging battle against the forces of evil, causing him to swing faster, hit better, and do more damage.  While under the effect of this Holy Fury, the Paladin's ability to defend himself is severely lowered.<BR><BR>In order to commit himself to the proper state of mind for this ability, the Paladin must be at full mana.
1060214	The <I>Dispel Evil</I> Paladin ability affects a small area around the Paladin.  Any evil creatures that come into the affected area may be destroyed or repelled, causing them to flee from combat.  This ability targets evil summoned creatures as well as non-summoned evil creatures.<BR><BR><I>Dispel Evil</I> can also target player Necromancers that are under effect of the <I>Wraith Form</I> spell.   The ability will cause transformed Necromancers to suffer some amount of Mana and Stamina loss.<BR><BR>The chance for successful use of this ability is modified by the Paladin's level of Karma and Chivalry skill.  While lower Karma will decrease the effectiveness of this ability, higher skill in Chivalry will increase it's effectiveness.
1060213	The <I>Consecrate Weapon</I> ability allows the Paladin to temporarily imbue the weapon he is holding with holy magic.<BR><BR> The result is a weapon that deals damage of a type equal to the target’s worst resistance.  In other words,  if a consecrated weapon attacks a Fire Elemental, whose worst resistance is to cold, each hit with the Consecrated Weapon will deal cold damage to that fire elemental.<BR><BR>The duration of the effect is based off of the Paladin's level of Karma and Chivalry skill.  Lower Karma will shorten the effect, but higher Chivalry skill will lengthen the effect.
1060212	<I>Close Wounds</I> is the basic healing ability for a Paladin.  Using this ability, allows the Paladin to target another player or creature for divine healing.  The amount of Hit Points healed depends on the Paladin’s level of Karma and their skill in Chivalry.  A lower level of Karma lowers the amount of healing but a higher skill level in Chivalry will raise the amount.
1060211	<I>Cleanse by Fire</I> is the basic Cure ability for the Paladin.  The Paladin uses the Cleanse by Fire ability to neutralize any poisons from a target.  When he does this, he takes an amount of fire damage based on a combination of his Karma and Chivalry levels.  The lower the Paladin's Karma, the higher the fire damage.  The higher the Paladin's Chivalry skill is, the lower the amount of fire damage taken.

1060139	You have made my work easy for me, ~1_NAME~.  My task here is done.
1060138	<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time, simply by returning to Mardoth's home and speaking with him using his context menu.<BR><BR>
1060137	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer! I see you've learned how to cash checks. Wonderful! Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land. For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Britain, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Moonglow or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure. So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself. Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia! We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow! May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1060136	Locate the nearest Bank using the enchanted sextant in your pack.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1060135	My new string
1060134	Use the enchanted sextant in your pack to locate the nearest bank.  Go there and speak with the Banker.
1060133	You have done as I asked... I knew I could count on you from the moment you walked in here!<BR><BR>The forces of evil are strong within you.  You will become a great Necromancer in this life - perhaps even the greatest.<BR><BR>My work for you is done here.  I release you from my service to go into the world and fight for our cause...<BR><BR>Oh...I almost forgot - your reward.  Here is a magical weapon and 2000 gold for you, in the form of a check.  Don't spend it all in one place though, eh?<BR><BR>Actually, before you can spend any of it at all, you will have to <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a> at the nearest bank.  Shopkeepers never accept checks for payment, they require cash.<BR><BR>In your pack, you will find an enchanted sextant.  Use this sextant to guide you to the nearest bank.<BR><BR>Farewell, and stay true to the ways of the shadow...
1060132	Although you were slain by the cowardly paladin, you managed to complete the rite of calling as instructed. Return to Mardoth.
1060131	Victory! You have done as Mardoth has asked of you. Take as much of your foe's loot as you can carry and return to Mardoth for your reward.
1060130	Use the Scroll of Calling (double click) near the Well of Tears to charge the waters for the arrival of Kronus.
1060129	You have arrived at the well, but no longer have the scroll of calling.  Use Mardoth's teleporter to return to the Crystal Cave and fetch another scroll from the box.
1060128	Follow the red lanterns to the Well of Tears where you will perform the calling of Kronus.
1060127	You have obtained the scroll of calling. See Mardoth for further instructions.
1060126	You have disposed of the creatures as Horus has asked. See him on your way out of the Crystal Cave to claim your reward.
1060125	Find the Crystal Cave password by reading (double click) the golden scroll entitled "Scroll of Abraxus" that you got from your familiar..
1060124	Step onto the teleporter near Mardoth and follow the path of glowing runes to the tomb of Maabus.
1060123	I will slay you before I allow you to complete your evil rites!
1060122	STOP WICKED ONE!
1060121	You have returned with the scroll!  I knew I could count on you.  You can now perform the rite of calling at the Well of Tears.  This ritual will help charge the Well to prepare for the coming of Kronus.   You are prepared to do your part young Necromancer!<BR><BR>Just outside of this tower, you will find a path lined with red lanterns.  Follow this path to get to the Well of Tears.  Once you have arrived at the Well, use the scroll to perform the ritual of calling.  Performing the rite will empower the well and bring us that much closer to the arrival of Kronus.<BR><BR>Once you have completed the ritual, return here for your promised reward.
1060120	You rummage through the scrolls until you find the Scroll of Calling.  You quickly put it in your pack.
1060119	Enter the Crystal Cave and find the Scroll of Calling.  The barrier will now allow you to pass.
1060118	Very well Paladin, you have proven to me your identity.  I grant thee passage.<BR><BR>Be careful, however – I’ve heard that the cave has been infested with a vermin of some sort.  Our High Lord Melkeer was supposed to send some troops to clear the vermin out of the cave, but that was last week already.  I fear that he forgot.<BR><BR>If you can find it in your goodness to dispose of at least 5 of those vermin in there, I shall reward your efforts.  If however you are too busy, and I would understand if you were, don’t bother with the vermin.<BR><BR>You may now pass through the energy barrier to enter the Crystal Cave.   Take care honorable Paladin soul.  Walk in the light my friend.
1060117	Speak the secret word that you read in the scroll stolen from the Vault to Horus the guard, using his <a href="?ForceTopic90">context menu</a>.
1060116	Security at the Crystal Cave<BR><BR>We have taken great measures to ensure the safety of the Scroll of Calling, which we have so valiantly taken from the Necromancer Maabus during the battle of the wood nearly 200 years ago.<BR><BR>The scroll must never fall into the hands of the Necromancers again, lest they use it to summon the ancient daemon Kronus.  The scroll of calling is a necessity in the series of dark rites the Necromancers must perform to once again re-awaken Kronus.<BR><BR>Should Kronus ever rise again, the days of the Paladins, and indeed humanity as we know it will be numbered.<BR><BR>For this reason, we have posted the honorable Horus, former General of the Northern Legions to guard the entrance of the Crystal Cave where we keep the Scroll of Calling.  Horus was infused with magical life from the tree Urywen during his last battle.  The power gave him eternal life, but it also, unfortunately, took his eye sight.<BR><BR>Since Horus cannot see those he admits to the Crystal Cave, he will only allow those that know the secret password to enter.  Speak the following word to Horus and he shall grant you passage to the Crystal Cave:<BR><BR><I>Urywen</I><BR><BR>Do not speak this password anywhere except when seeking passage into the Crystal Cave, as our adversaries are lurking in the shadows – they are everywhere.<BR><BR>Go with the light, friend.<BR><BR><I>- Frater Melkeer</I>
1060115	Now that you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave to speak with the guard there.  Use the teleporter outside of the vault to get there if necessary.
1060114	You have obtained the Scroll of Abraxus, which contains the secret password needed to gain passage into the Crystal Cave where the Scroll of Calling is kept.  Read the scroll (double click) and figure out the password.<BR><BR>Once you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave and speak the password to the guard.<BR><BR>If you do not know the way to the Crystal Cave from the Paladin City, you can use the magic teleporter located just outside of the vault.
1060113	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the scroll for you.
1060112	This would be a good opportunity to summon your familiar.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds this Vault.<BR><BR><a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon your familiar</a> and will it to fetch the book for you.
1060111	You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the book for you.
1060110	You have arrived in the Vault of Secrets.  You can feel the protective magic in this place restricting you, making you feel nearly claustrophobic.<BR><BR>Just ahead of you and out of your reach, you see a collection of scrolls and books, one of them being entitled 'Scroll of Abraxus' .  You can only assume that this scroll holds the current password required to enter the Crystal Cave.<BR><BR>This would be a good opportunity to <a href="?ForceTopic127">summon your familiar</a>.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds the Vault.<BR><BR>Summon your familiar with the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell.
1060109	Follow the road paved with glowing runes to find the Vault of Secrets.  Be careful not to give yourself away as a Necromancer while in the city.
1060108	Use the teleporter near Mardoth to be transported to the Paladin City of Light.
1060107	<I>Mardoth looks at you expectantly until you tell him that you failed to retrieve the scroll...</I><BR><BR>You failed?  Very unfortunate...  So now you must find your way into the paladin’s Vault of Secrets, eh?  Well, you won't be able to get in – there is a powerful magic aura that protects the Vault from all Necromancers.  We simply cannot enter.  However, that's not to say your familiar spirit can't.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth grins with obvious satisfaction as he explains the details of the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell to you...</I>, which will allow you to summon a scavenging Horde Minion to steal the scroll.<BR><BR>Very well.  You are prepared to go.  Take the teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing to transport to the Paladin city of Light.  Once you have arrived in the city, follow the road of glowing runes to the Vault of Secrets.  You know what to do.
1060106	Infiltrate the city of the Paladins and figure out a way into the Vault. See Mardoth for help with this objective.
1060105	<I>An old man, dressed in slightly tattered armor, whom you recognize to be a Paladin stands before the Crystal Cave staring blankly into the space in front of him.  As he begins to speak to you, you realize this man is blind.  You attempt to persuade the blind man that you are a Paladin seeking to inspect the scroll of calling...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>You seek entrance to the Crystal Cave, home of the Calling Scroll?  Hmm.  You reak of death and decay, brother.  You reak of death like a Necromancer, but yet you claim to be a Paladin in hopes that I will grant thee passage into the cave?<BR><BR>Please don’t think ill of me for this, but I’m just a blind, old man looking to keep the brotherhood of Paladins safe from the clutches of the elder daemon Kronus.  The Necromancers have been after this particular scroll for quite some time, so we must take all the security precautions we can.<BR><BR>Before I can let you pass into the Crystal Cave, you must speak to me the secret word that is kept in the Scroll of Abraxus in the Vault of Secrets at the Paladin city of Light.  It’s the only way that I can be sure you are who you claim to be, since Necromancers cannot enter the Vault due to powerful protective magic that the brotherhood has blessed the vault with.
1060104	Take the teleporter in the corner of Maabus' tomb to the crystal cave where the calling scroll is kept.
1060103	<I>Maabus emits an ear-crawling screech as his body reanimates.  He turns and angrily screams at you</I>:<BR><BR>YOU INFIDEL!  HOW DARE YOU AWAKEN MAABUS!?!<BR><BR><I>Maabus continues to scream at you angrily for some time.  As he settles down, you explain to him the purpose of your visit.  Once you explain that you are on a quest to summon the elder daemon Kronus, Maabus begins to cooperate, and begins to speak in a more reasonable tone</I>:<BR><BR>Well, why didn’t you say so?  If you’re going to raise Kronus from the Well of Tears, you must first complete a long series of dark rituals.  I once owned one of the scrolls needed for the summoning, but alas it was lost to me when I lost my life to a cowardly Paladin ambush near the Paladin city of Light.  They would have probably hidden the scroll in their precious crystal cave near the city.<BR><BR>There is a teleporter in the corner of this tomb.  It will transport you near the crystal cave at which I believe one of the calling scrolls is hidden.  Good luck.<BR><BR><I>Maabus' body slumps back into the coffin as your magic expires</I>.
1060102	Re-animate the corpse of Maabus using your <a href="?ForceTopic112">Animate Dead</a> spell and question him about the Kronus rituals.
1060101	...
1060100	...
1060099	Excellent choice, young apprentice of evil!<BR><BR>I will not waste our time with pleasantries.  There is much work to be done – especially in light of the recent Paladin ambushes that we have suffered.  The necromantic brotherhood is working towards the summoning of the elder daemon Kronus, who will rise from the Well of Tears to help us finally crush the Paladin forces that have plagued our lands for so long now.<BR><BR>To summon Kronus, we must energize the Well of Tears with a series of dark rituals.  Unfortunately the rituals needed to sufficiently energize the Well of Tears have been lost to us.  Your task will be to recover one of the ritual scrolls needed for the summoning.<BR><BR>You will need to find the corpse of the Arch Necromancer Maabus, which has been laid to rest in the tomb of elders.  We believe his spirit may have memory of where we may find the scrolls needed for the summoning.  You will need to awaken him from the slumber of death, using your Animate Dead spell, of course.<BR><BR>To reach the tomb, step onto the magical teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing.<BR><BR>Once you have been teleported, follow the path, which will lead you to the tomb of Maabus.<BR><BR>One more thing before you go:<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry. I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>. Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this tower.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.

1060094	<I>An old man who looks to be 200 years old from the looks of his translucently pale and heavily wrinkled skin, turns to you and gives you a half-cocked grin that makes you feel somewhat uneasy.<BR><BR> After a short pause, he begins to speak to you...</I><BR><BR>Hmm. What's this?  Another budding Necromancer to join the ranks of Evil?  Here... let me take a look at you...  Ah yes...  Very Good! I sense the forces of evil are strong within you, child – but you need training so that you can learn to focus your skills against those aligned against our cause.  You are destined to become a legendary Necromancer - with the proper training, that only I can give you.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth pauses just long enough to give you a wide, skin-crawling grin.</I><BR><BR>Let me introduce myself.  I am Mardoth, the guildmaster of the Necromantic Brotherhood.  I have taken it upon myself to train anyone willing to learn the dark arts of Necromancy.  The path of destruction, decay and obliteration is not an easy one.  Only the most evil and the most dedicated can hope to master the sinister art of death.<BR><BR>I can lend you training and help supply you with equipment – in exchange for a few services rendered by you, of course.  Nothing major, just a little death and destruction here and there - the tasks should be easy as a tasty meat pie for one as treacherous and evil as yourself.<BR><BR>What do you say?

Nice autograph.<BR><BR>One last task. I would like a set of toy monster figurines made by the famous toymaker, Tomas O'Neerlan. You'll find him in Trinsic. He's often at the Tinker's Guild. Try looking there.<BR><BR>You're doing quite well. Quite well indeed. Knew you would. Just like old times. Yes. Quite good.
1055115	<I>Elwood scratches his ear then notices you.</I><BR><BR>Good day. What brings you to the Albatross? Me? An autograph? You want my autograph? Well, I suppose. What's that? Oh. Yes. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Get his autograph and return to me. Good day.

1055105	<I>Elwood jumps and almost falls from his stool when you tap his shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Oh my. Don't do that. Scared me half to death. Sneaking up on people like that. I don't even know you. Yes, I do. I do know you. Ordered a pizza from you and never received it. I'm rather miffed about that.<BR><BR>No. No. Wait. Of course. Not the pizza. You're here with the moonfire brew I wanted. Magical moonfire brew. Not sure what it is. Just want some.<BR><BR>What's that? Oh. The autograph. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Of course. Do you have it? No. Well. Hmm. Don't sneak up on people like that.

1055103	<I>Gabriel sighs loudly as you address him and stops whatever it was that he was doing.</I><BR><BR>WHAT?!? Can you not see that I'm working here?  Ugh, sometimes I wish they'd just lock the outer doors to anyone who doesn't belong here. So go ahead and fawn. Get it over with, and then leave. Sooner you're out of here, the sooner I'm back to work.<BR><BR>I see. So you want an autograph. Fine. If it'll get rid of you, I'll give you my autograph. But I'll only sign some sheet music for one of my songs. Until then, please let me get back to work.<BR><BR>You can probably find some of my sheet music at one of the theaters in the land. When I perform there, they often sell it as a souvenir. Speak to the impresario... the theater manager. My last three performances were in Nujel'm, Jhelom, and here in Britian.
1055102	<I>Alberta stops cleaning her brushes and looks your way.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, I'll send the painting to Elwood once it's dry. Please let him know that the painting has been finished.

1055100	<I>Elwood notices you immediately and waves you over.</I><BR><BR>You're back. Good. That's good. Hmm. You don't seem to have that painting yet. Don't tell me Alberta refused. That's no good. I made her what she is! She was living in the gutter when I found her. The gutter. And she has the... what's that? Oh, she finished the portrait. Right. Good. Can always count on Alberta. Always. Best painter in the land.<BR><BR>Just have a couple... er... wait... make that... two more task for you. Then our business will be concluded. For now.

Between performances. Hurry now. There ya go.<BR><BR><I>Elwood falls silent though his lips are still  moving. It looks like he's quietly repeating the word, "autograph."</I>
1055099	Return to Elwood and let him know that the painting is complete.
1055098	<I>Alberta stands back from the canvas and surveys her work.</I><BR><BR>Not too bad. Quite good even, if I do say so myself. As always, of course.<BR><BR>Oh, you're still here. Please let Elwood know that the painting has been completed. I'll have it sent to him once it dries.<BR><BR><I>Alberta removes the portrait from her easel and sets it aside to dry.</I>
1055097	<I>Elwood drums his fingers on the counter then looks up at you expectantly.</I><BR><BR>Ah, finally. I'm famished. This so-called tavern doesn't even serve pizza, so one must have it delivered. It's an outrage. Er... wait. Where's my pizza? Yes, my pizza. What kind of delivery is this? Didn't even bring my pizza. This will severely impact your tip, I'm afraid.<BR><BR>Hold on a moment. You were helping me with something else, weren't you? Ah. Yes. I've got it now. You were to have a portrait done. Well. Good. Yes. But let's not dawdle. Off you go. If you happen to see anyone with my pizza, please insist they hurry.<BR><BR>
1055096	<I>Alberta looks at you sympathetically.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, this will only take a few seconds. I realize that stool can be uncomfortable, and I apologize for that. Perhaps I should replace it with a more comfortable chair. But then again, it's that very discomfort that helps produce such wonderful facial expressions for my paintings. Ah well.
1055095	You must remain seated on the stool until the portrait is complete. Alberta will now have to start again with a fresh canvas.
1055094	<I>Elwood yawns and stretches, then focuses his gaze on you.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Do I know you? Hold on a second. Yes. Yes, I do. You were going to bring me some rainbow pearls. Wait. No. You already did that. I remember now. Right. So go get that portrait painted. Alberta is in Vesper. Go to her. Alberta Giacco. Come back when she's done.
1055093	Sit on the stool in front of Alberta's easel so that she can paint your portrait. You'll need to sit there for about 30 seconds.
1055092	<I>Alberta looks up from the painting she is working on and faces you.</I><BR><BR>Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in the middle of something, and can't... oh wait, I see. You must be the one Elwood sent over.<BR><BR>Very well. If you'll have a seat on the stool over there, we'll get started. This will just take a few seconds. I paint quite quickly, you see. I'll start once you are seated.<BR><BR><I>Alberta exchanges the painting she was working on for a blank canvas.</I>
1055091	Go to Vesper and speak to Alberta Giacco at the Colored Canvas.
1055090	<I>Elwood jumps slightly when you call his name.</I><BR><BR>What. I'm awake. Oh, It's you. Hey, look at those pearls. Beautiful. Wow. Where'd you get those... oh right. I sent you to get them. From the lake. Lake Haven. Great job. Gotta love rainbow pearls. Oooh, Colors.<BR><BR>Okay, let's see. Next. Need a painting. Go to the Colored Canvas and speak to Alberta. Alberta Giacco. Best painter I've ever met. Ask her to do a painting of you. Yes. Of you. A portrait. Never know if you might up and become famous one day. Need to have a painting of you in my collection. From now. Before all the fame. Go. Alberta awaits. She's in Vesper.<BR><BR><I>Elwood starts playing with the pearls you brought him and seems to have forgotten you're there.</I>
1055089	<I>Elwood looks up as you tap him on the shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Good. Good. You're back. Wait. You don't have the rainbow pearls I need. Taking a break? Yeah. Sure. There's no hurry. Let me know when you've got all those pearls, though. I'll be here.
1055088	You've collected enough rainbow pearls. Speak to Elwood to give them to him and get your next task.
1055087	You pull a shellfish out of the water, but it doesn't have a rainbow pearl.
1055086	You pull a shellfish out of the water, and find a rainbow pearl inside of it.
1055085	Rainbow pearls collected: 
1055084	Fish up shellfish from Lake Haven and collect rainbow pearls.
1055083	<I>Elwood slaps his knee and grins at you.</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes. That's the spirit. I knew it. Knew it when I first saw you. You remind me so much of your dear departed father. Or someone. Not sure. Maybe no one. But that's okay. Ah, good times.<BR><BR>Anyway, so as you know, I'm a collector. Got all kinds of interesting things laying around back at my warehouse. You know. You've seen it. Haven't you? Yes? No? Nevermind. Not important.<BR><BR>Right. So, always trying to add new things to my collection. Or sometimes just get more of something. Can't have too many. Right? Yeah? Sure.<BR><BR>Let's see. Where to start. Oh, I know. Pearls. Yes. But not just any pearls. Rainbow pearls. Yes. From the lake here in Haven. Seems all that magic Uzeraan was throwing around when he transformed the island had an interesting effect on some of the shellfish down there. Exactly, rainbow pearls. Useless for magic, but an item worth collecting. Trust me on this. Trust me.<BR><BR>Need you to go fish some up for me. Down at the lake. Lake Haven. Off ya go. Happy fishing!<BR><BR><I>Elwood turns back to his ale and now seems oblivious to you.</I>
1055082	<I>Elwood looks a bit flustered and nearly knocks over his bottle of ale.</I><BR><BR>Well, I see. It's like that, is it? Yes. Well then. Okay. You've changed. Yes. Yes, you have. Something's changed. I know I haven't. Not me. Not good ole Elwood.<BR><BR><I>Elwood trails off, though you can still hear him muttering softly.</I>
1055081	<I>Elwood greets you warmly, like an old friend he's not quite sure he ever had.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Yes. Sit down. Please. Good. Okay, stand. Up to you.<BR><BR>So, what brings you to these parts... hey, wait. Just had a thought. Would you like to do me a favor? Yes, really. You know, for old times sake. The good ole days. You were always one of my best suppliers. Or maybe you weren't, who knows any more. Anyway, could use some help supplementing my stock. You know me. Always looking for something new to add to the collection. Or sometimes not so new - just more of the same. But don't have to tell you that. You know, don't you. Yes. Just like old times. That's what it'll be. You and me - together again. Ah, it's been too long.<BR><BR>So what do you think? The fee will be the same as always. I'm a fair man. You know that. So what do you say?
1055080	<I>Elwood looks up from his ale as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>What's that? Who me? No, no. You must be looking for someone else.

1055064	<I>The wrinkled old crone stops stirring her noxious stew, looking up at you with an annoyed expression on her face.</I><BR><BR>You again? Listen, you little wretch, I'm in no mood for any of your meddlesome requests. I've work to do, and no time for your whining.<BR><BR>Come back later, and maybe I'll have something for you to do. In the meantime, get out of my sight - and don't touch anything on your way out!<BR><BR><I>The vile hag hacks up a gob of phlegm, spitting it on the ground before returning to her work.</I>
1055063	<I>The wrinkled old hag stops stirring her noxious stew for a moment to look up at you as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Eh? What's that? You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well now, my little one, I'd like to discuss your reward with you, but it seems you won't have enough room to carry it even if I do provide you with your treat.  Perhaps you'd best remove some items from that overstuffed pack of yours and talk to me when you're ready.<BR><BR><I>The witch goes back to stirring the contents of her bubbling cauldron.  You'd best make room in your pack for the Hag's reward before speaking to her again.</I>
1055062	You have received the Magic Brew Recipe.

1055059	<I>The filthy Captain flashes a pleased grin at you as he looks you up and down.</I><BR><BR>Well that's more like it, me little deck swabber!  Ye almost look like ye fit in around here, ready te sail the great seas of Britannia, sinking boats and slaying sea serpents!<BR><BR>But can ye truly handle yerself?  Ye might think ye can test me meddle with a sip or two of yer dandy wine, but a real pirate walks the decks with a belly full of it.  Lookit that, yer not even wobblin'!<BR><BR>Ye've impressed me a bit, ye wee tyke, but it'll take more'n that te join me crew!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart tips his mug in your direction, offering up a jolly laugh, but it seems you still haven't impressed him enough.</I>
1055058	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from his drink, almost tipping over his chair as he looks you up and down.</I><BR><BR>You again?  I thought I told ye te get lost?  Go on with ye!  Ye ain't no pirate - yer not even fit te clean the barnacles off me rear end!  Don't ye come back babbling te me for any of me Blackheart Whiskey until ye look and act like a true pirate!<BR><BR>Now shove off, sewer rat - I've got drinkin' te do!<BR><BR><I>The inebriated pirate bolts back another mug of ale and brushes you off with a wave of his hand.</I>
1055057	<I>Captain Blackheart looks up from polishing his cutlass, glaring at you with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Well, well.  Lookit the wee little deck swabby.  Aren't ye a cute lil' lassy?  Don't ye look just fancy?  Ye think yer ready te join me pirate crew?  Ye think I should offer ye some've me special Blackheart brew?<BR><BR>I'll make ye walk the plank, I will!  We'll see how sweet n' darlin' ye look when the sea serpents get at ye and rip ye te threads!  Won't that be a pretty picture, eh?<BR><BR>Ye don't have the stomach fer the pirate life, that's plain enough te me.  Ye prance around here like a wee lil' princess, ye do.  If ye want to join my crew ye can't just look tha part - ye have to have the stomach fer it, filled up with rotgut until ye can't see straight.  I don't drink with just any ol' landlubber!  Ye'd best prove yer mettle before ye talk te me again!<BR><BR><I>The drunken pirate captain leans back in his chair, taking another gulp of his drink before he starts in on another bawdy pirate song.</I>
1055056	<I>The inebriated pirate looks up at you with a wry grin.</I><BR><BR>Well hello again, me little matey.  I see ye have a belly full of rotgut in ye.  I bet ye think you're a right hero, ready te face the world.  But as I told ye before, bein' a member of my pirate crew means more'n just being able to hold yer drink.  Ye have te look the part - and frankly, me little barnacle, ye don't have the cut of cloth te fit in with the crowd I like te hang around.<BR><BR>So scurry off, ye wee sewer rat, and don't come back round these parts all liquored up an' three sheets te tha wind, unless yer truly ready te join me pirate crew!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart shoves you aside, banging his cutlass against the table as he calls to the waitress for another round.</I>
1055055	You are still attempting to obtain a jug of Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, but the drunkard Captain refuses to share his unique brew.  You must prove your worthiness as a pirate to Blackheart before he'll offer you a jug.
1055054	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.</I><BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Just in from sailin' the glorious sea?  Ye look right ready te fall down on the spot, ye do!<BR><BR>I tell ye what, from the look've ye, ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.  Why, a keg of this stuff once spilled on my ship, and it ate a hole right through the deck!<BR><BR>Go on, drink up, or use it to clean the rust off your cutlass - it's the best brew, either way!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart hands you a jug of his famous Whiskey. You think it best to return it to the Hag, rather than drink any of the noxious swill.</I>

1055013	<I>The horrible wretch of a witch looks up from her vile experiments and focuses her one good eye on you.</I><BR><BR>Eh?  What's that?  You say you've gathered the ingredients for my delicious Magic Brew?<BR><BR>Well, well, I don't know exactly what to say.  I thought for sure you'd end up dead!  Haw!  Can't blame a lady for wishing, can you?  Even if she is a bit old and wrinkled.<BR><BR>Well, I promised you a reward for your efforts, and I never lie - leastways not to someone like you, after the great sacrifices you've made.  You know, I could use a new Apprentice, in an official capacity as it were.  I couldn't convince you to stay around and help me out some more could I?  There's always cauldrons that need cleaning, dung that needs shoveling, newts eye that needs a proper chewing, and fires that need stoking.<BR><BR>What's that? Not interested?  Well, I suppose you have great things ahead of you and all that. Feh! Like a puckish little puke like you could ever make something of themselves in this cold old world!<BR><BR>Nevertheless, I'll give you your blasted reward, and you'd better be happy with it because it's all you're getting.  Caused me enough trouble as it is.  Here, take it, and be off with you!  It'll be a pleasure to my eye if I never have to squint to see you again!  And the stench!  Smells like you washed this very morning!  A great fancy folk you are, with your soaps and water!  Think you're so great...why, I remember when we didn't even have soap, and water was made by tiny little fairies and cost a gold piece for a thimbleful...I could tell you some stories, I could...<BR><BR><I>Your reward in hand, you decide to leave the old Hag to her mumblings before she realizes you're still around and puts you back to work.</I>
1055012	<I>The ancient crone looks up from her bubbling brew, staring you down with her one good eye.</I><BR><BR>You've returned already have you?  And what of your task?  Have you gathered all the needed ingredients?<BR><BR>What's that!?  You still haven't finished the simple little task I've set before you?  Then why come back here and bother me?  I can't get a single brew concocted if you keep bugging me with your whimpering little diatribes!  Why, you're worse than my last apprentice - and he was the very king of fools!<BR><BR>Go on with ye!  Away and begone!  I don't want to see hide nor hair of your whining little face until you've gathered each and every last one of the ingredients on that list!<BR><BR><I>With a disgusting hacking noise, the vile witch spits upon the ground and brushes you off with a wave of her wrinkled old hand.</I>
1055011	<I>The drunken pirate, Captain Blackheart, looks up from his bottle of whiskey with a pleased expression.</I><BR><BR>Well looky here!  I didn't think a landlubber like yourself had the pirate blood in ye!  But look at that!  You certainly look the part now!  Sure you can still keep on your feet?  Har!<BR><BR>Avast ye, ye loveable pirate!  Ye deserve a belt of better brew than the slop ye've been drinking, and I've just the thing.<BR><BR>I call it Captain Blackheart's Whiskey, and it'll give ye hairs on yer chest, that's for sure.  Why, a keg of this stuff once spilled on my ship, and it ate a hole right through the deck!<BR><BR>Go on, drink up, or use it to clean the rust off your cutlass - it's the best brew, either way!<BR><BR><I>Captain Blackheart hands you a jug of his famous Whiskey.

1055010	<I>The bawdy old pirate captain looks up from his bottle of Wild Harpy whiskey, as drunk as any man you've ever seen.<BR><BR>With an excruciatingly slow movement, he pushes back his tricorne hat and stares you down with red-rimmed eyes.</I><BR><BR>Whut tha blazes do ye want, landlubber?  Some've Captain Blackheart's fine Whiskey?  Well ye can drown in the seven seas, ya barnacle-covered bilge rat!<BR><BR>I've cut down pasty-faced runts like yerself for lesser insults!  I've sailed the seas've this world fer fifty years, and never seen a more milk-soaked pansy lass than ye come in here for a favor.  Give ye some of my special Whiskey?  I'd sooner wrestle a sea serpent naked - and I've done that some twenty times!<BR><BR>Ye see, ol' Captain Blackheart's Whiskey is only for pirate folk.  And ye don't look like no pirate I've ever seen.  Ye have te have the right cut of cloth and the right amount of liquor in yer belly te sail on my crew!  And without that, ye might as well go home and cry to yer mommy.  Cause ye ain't ever gonna share no drink with me!<BR><BR>Now off with ye!<BR><BR><I>With that, Captain Blackheart goes back to singing his bawdy songs and drinking his whiskey.  It seems as if you'll have to find some way to change his mind about your worthiness.</I>
1055009	<I>The wart-covered witch looks up from pouring fetid scraps of meat into her cauldron.</I><BR><BR>You've dealt with that troublesome imp Zeefzorpul?  Good for you, little one!  You're not as useless as you appear, even to a daft old wench such as myself!<BR><BR>Now then, I see you've recovered my precious Magic Brew Recipe.  I suppose you expect a reward?  Well, you can go on expecting, and I can go on being ugly.  What good is it to me that I have the list, if I don't have an apprentice to go gather the ingredients and perform the tasks themselves!<BR><BR>If you want your precious little reward, you'll have to complete the task I gave to my previous Apprentice.  Now away with you!  Shoo! Shimmy! Skedattle!  I've heads to boil and stews to spice!  Don't you return until you've completed every item on that list!
1055008	<I>In a puff of smoke that smells of brimstone, the imp Zeefzorpul appears.</I><BR><BR>Wuh-whut!? How did stupid hooman find mighty Zeefzorpul?  This crazy many times!  This crazy not possible! This big crazy with crazy on top!  But it happening!  How can it be true!?<BR><BR>GAH! Even mighty Zeefzorpul can no resist that crazy music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul do what you want!  Have you stupid paper back!  Mighty Zeefzorpul no want it any way.  It dumb.  It super dumb.  Big dumb like stupid dumb tree with dumb things on it!  So stupid!  So dumb that mighty Zeefzorpul not even care!  You see me not caring?  You better cause it certainly happening!  Me not caring one bit!<BR><BR><I>The strange little imp tosses the piece of parchment at you.  Much to your surprise, however, he swoops down in a flash of flapping wings and steals the Magic Flute from your grasp.</I><BR><BR>Hah! So stupid like a hooman!  Mighty Zeefzorpul has defeated stupid hooman and is greatest ever imp in world!  You serious stupid, mister hooman.  Big stupid with stupid on top.  Now you no can make trick on me again with crazy dance music!  Mighty Zeefzorpul fly away to his other secret home where you never find him again!<BR><BR>Me hope you get eated by a troll!<BR><BR><I>With that, the imp Zeefzorpul disappears in another puff of rancid smoke.</I>
1055007	<I>The wretched imp cries out for mercy.</I><BR><BR>Forgive me! You master! You great warrior, great hooman, great greatest! Forgive! Forgive! I give up Zeef! He no good any way!  He always smack me head and hurt me good!  He say I ugly too, even with me pretty teef!<BR><BR>But I knows where he hide!  I follow him flapping to his hidey hole.  He think he so smart but he so wrong!  I make scribble drawing of where he like to hide!  But you need the whistle blower to make him come!  He no come without it!  Make with the whistle at his hidey place, and Zeef must come, he cannot resist!<BR><BR><I>The frightened imp hands you a crumpled map and a strange flute.</I><BR><BR>You go to where the picture shows and then you play that whistle!  Zeef come, me promise!  But you make promise that you smack Zeef head good!  Pweese?<BR><BR><I>With this last request, the miserable little imp falls and breathes no more.</I>
1055006	<I>The sickly old hag looks up from her boiling cauldron.</I><BR><BR>Have you found that vile little Zeefzorpul yet?  What!?  You've come back here without finding out where Zeefzorpul is, and what he's done with my Magic Brew Recipe?<BR><BR>I told you what needs to be done, you little whelp!  Now away with ye!  And don't you return until you've found my list of ingredients!
1055005	<I>The wrinkled old Hag looks up from her cauldron of boiling innards.</I><BR><BR>Bah!  Back already?  Can't you see I'm busy with my cooking?  You wouldn't like to have a little taste of my delicious dragon gizzard soup, would you?  Haw! I thought as much.<BR><BR>Enough of this jibber-jabber then - what news of my Apprentice?<BR><BR>What's that?  You say that horrible little imp Zeefzorpul was behind his disappearance!?  What would Zeefzorpul want with my Apprentice?  Probably just wants to make life more miserable for me than it already is.<BR><BR>Wait! Bah! That must be it! Zeefzorpul must have found out that I sent my Apprentices out with various Magic Brew Recipes - lists of tasks and ingredients that needed completing.<BR><BR>That despicable Zeefzorpul knows I need the list of ingredients I gave to that Apprentice.  I've recipes to mix, stews to boil, magics to cast, and fortunes to meddle!  I won't let that wretched felchscum spoil my day.  You then, I need you to go find Zeefzorpul and get that scrap of parchment back!<BR><BR>I'm not sure where he bides his time, but I'm sure if you go find his imp friends and rough them up, they'll squeal on him in no time!  They all know each others' secret hiding places.  Go on!  Shoo! Go slay a few imps until they cough up their secrets!  No mercy for those little nasties!
1055004	You inspect the charred and bloodied corpse, recognizing it from the Hag's description as the lost Apprentice you were tasked to bring back.<BR><BR>It appears as if he has been scorched by fire and magic, and scratched at with vicious claws.<BR><BR>You wonder if this horrific act is the work of the vile imp Zeefzorpul of which the Hag spoke.  You decide you'd best return to the Hag and report your findings.
1055003	<I>The wrinkled hag looks up at you with venom in her eyes.</I><BR><BR>What're you doing back here?  I thought I told you to go find my lost Apprentice!  I don't have time for your laziness, you wretched little worm!  Shoo! Away with ye! And don't come back until you've found out what's happened to my Apprentice!
1055002	<I>Somewhat out of character for the vile old witch, she actually seems delighted that you've accepted her offer.</I><BR><BR>Ah! That's the spirit! You're not a useless bag of bones after all, are ye?  Well then, best get your hind quarters in gear and head towards the road!  Remember, my young Apprentice could be anywhere along the road heading towards the Yew Graveyard, so be sure to run the whole course of it, and stay on track!<BR><BR>And for Gashnak's sake, come back here when you've found something! And remember, I don't have all day!  And watch out for the imp Zeefzorpul!  And don't return empty handed!  And pack a warm sweater!  And don't trample my lawn on the way out!<BR><BR>What are you still doing here?  Get to it!  Shoo!
1055001	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>Eh? Who is it? Who's there?  Come to trouble an old woman have you?<BR><BR>I'll split ye open and swallow yer guts!  I'll turn ye into a pile o' goo, I will!  Bah!  As if I didn't have enough to worry about.  As if I've not enough trouble as it is!<BR><BR>Another of my blasted apprentices has gone missing!  Foolish children, think they know everything.  I should turn the lot of them into toads - if only they'd return with their task complete!  But that's the trouble, innit?  They never return!<BR><BR>But you don't care, do ye?  I suppose you're another one of those meddlesome kids, come to ask me for something?  Eh?  Is that it?  You want something from me, expect me to hand it over?  I've enough troubles with my apprentices, and that vile imp, Zeefzorpul!  Why, I bet it's him who's got the lot of them!  And who knows what he's done?  Vile little thing.<BR><BR>If you expect me to help you with your silly little desires, you'll be doing something for me first, eh?  I expect you to go seek out my apprentice.  I sent him along the road west of here up towards Yew's graveyard, but he never came back. Find him, and bring him back, and I'll give you a little reward that I'm sure you'll find pleasant.<BR><BR>But I tells ye to watch out for the imp name've Zeefzorpul!  He's a despicable little beast who likes to fool and fiddle with folk and generally make life miserable for everyone.  If ye get him on your bad side, you're sure to end up ruing the day ye were born. As if you didn't already, with an ugly mug like that!<BR><BR>Well, you little whelp?  Going to help an old hag or not?
1055000	<I>The ancient, wrinkled hag looks up from her vile-smelling cauldron.  Her single, unblinking eye attempts to focus in on you, but to little avail.</I><BR><BR>What's that?  Who's there?  What do you want with me?  I don't have time for the likes of you.  I have stews to spice and brews to boil.  Too many things to complete to be helping out a stranger.<BR><BR>Besides, it looks as if you've already got yourself a quest that needs doing.  Perhaps if you finish the task you're on, you can return to me and I'll help you out.  But until then, leave an old witch alone to her magics!  Shoo!  Away with ye!<BR><BR><I>The witch rushes you off with a wave of her decrepit hand and returns to tending the noxious brew boiling in her cauldron.</I>

1077786	Finally! I was getting thirsty. Thank you.<br><br>Ok, so I've read some more of this book, and it does appear that Sin'Vraal's thinking was on track. As I'm sure you know, Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is compelled to oppose the Principle of Love and everything related to it. What you may not know is that Love and Hatred are entwined at a very basic level, and one cannot exist without the other to put it in perspective, nor can one become too influential without the other diminishing an equal amount.<br><br>From what I've read in this book, it's clear that by corrupting the shrines and extinguishing the Candle of Love, Astaroth is attempting to spread the influence of Hatred in the world. The more Hatred that exists, the less Love's presence is felt, and the more powerful Astaroth becomes! Obviously, we cannot let the balance swing too far in Astaroth's favor if we are to have any hope of thwarting his future plans.<br><br>The Candle of Love itself is kept in a cavern underneath the Abbey, far below where we're standing now. The entrance to the cavern can be found in the back room of the winery next door. However, the tunnel leading to the cavern is dark, and it seems that no normal light can pierce this unnatural darkness.<br><br>From what we’ve been able to discern, in order to enter this impenetrable curtain of darkness that now enshrouds the cavern, many brave adventurers will need to purify the light from a regular candle and then touch the purified flame to the Candle of Love. However, it all starts with one person... you.<br><br>Quickly, go to each of the three shrines and help cleanse them. Then meditate on each virtue, and the way forward will be shown to you. Only through doing this might you help oppose Astaroth's growing power.
1077785	Where's my ale? I'm really thirsty!
1077784	You've failed to fetch Anne a bottle of ale! Return to Anne to see if she'll let you get her another bottle of ale.
1077783	It's just downstairs! Do you want me to study this book or not?
1077782	Just from looking at the first few pages, I think SinVraal was correct in sending you to me. I'll need some time to read more to be sure.<br><br>I'm feeling really thirsty though, so can you do me a favor? Fetch me a bottle of ale from the Innkeeper downstairs, and I'll study this while you're gone.
1077780	A Book of Ancient Gargish Prophicies
1077779	A Dark Flame
1077778	Greetings, how may I help thee?<br><br>*Anne listens to your story*<br><br>Oh my! Astaroth you say? Well, Sin'Vraal may very well be right. Let me take a look at the book.
1077777	You've failed to deliver the book to Empath Abbey. Return to Sin'Vraal to get another book.
1077776	To wish that you would hurry. To know that there is not much time.
1077775	To not know what to say. To think that perhaps you do not understand the seriousness of the situation. To hope you return soon to help.
1077774	To greet you wholeheartedly. To feel thankful for your willingness to help.<br><br>To not be able to see? To think that if the shrines of Compassion, Justice and Sacrifice are involved that it is likely that Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is behind the darkness. To know that such powerful magic can be countered, but to believe that only by seeking the innate power of the opposite can it be done.<br><br>To recommend that you seek out more knowledge at Empath Abbey. To know that the monks there study how Love can overcome Hatred. To want you to take this book to the Keeper of the Flame at Empath Abbey. To suspect that she will understand.<br><br>To wish you good fortune against such a terrible foe.

1077757	Dang gun it! If that don't beat all! Ya went and did it, didn’t ya? What we got ourselves here is a mighty fine brand spankin’ new Apprentice Miner!<br><br>I can see ya put some meat on them bones too while you were at it!<br><br>Here’s that little somethin’ I told ya I had for ya. It’s a pickaxe with some high falutin’ magic inside that’ll help you find the good stuff when you’re off minin’. It wears out fast, though, so you can only use it a few times a day.<br><br>Welp, I’ve got some smeltin’ to do, so off with ya. Good luck, pilgrim!
1077756	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Miner. Return to Jacob Waltz in at his camp in the hills above New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077755	Where ya been off a gallivantin’ all day, pilgrim? You ain’t seen no hard work yet! Get yer arse back out there to my mine and dig up some more iron. Don’t forget to take a pickaxe or shovel, and if you’re so inclined, a packhorse too.
1077754	Couldn’t find my iron mine, could ya? Well, neither can I!<br><br>*Jacob laughs*<br><br>Oh, ya don’t wanna find it? Well, allrighty then, ya might as well head on back down to town then and stop cluttering up my camp. Come back and talk to me if you’re interested in learnin’ ‘bout minin’.
1077753	Find Jacob's Lost Mine and mine iron ore there, using a pickaxe or shovel. Bring it back to Jacob's forge and smelt the ore into ingots, until you have raised your Mining skill to 50. You may find a packhorse useful for hauling the ore around. The animal trainer in New Haven has packhorses for sale.<br><center>-----</center><br>Howdy! Welcome to my camp. It's not much, I know, but it's all I'll be needin' up here. I don't need them fancy things those townspeople have down there in New Haven. Nope, not one bit. Just me, Bessie, my pick and a thick vein 'o valorite.<br><br>Anyhows, I'm guessin' that you're up here to ask me about minin', aren't ya? Well, don't be expectin' me to tell you where the valorite's at, cause I ain't gonna tell the King of Britannia, much less the likes of you. But I will show ya how to mine and smelt iron, cause there certainly is a 'nough of up in these hills.<br><br>*Jacob looks around, with a perplexed look on his face*<br><br>Problem is, I can't remember where my iron mine's at, so you'll have to find it yourself. Once you're there, have at it with a pickaxe or shovel, then haul it back to camp and I'll show ya how to smelt it. Ya look a bit wimpy, so you might wanna go buy yourself a packhorse in town from the animal trainer to help you haul around all that ore.<br><br>When you're an Apprentice Miner, talk to me and I'll give ya a little somethin' I've got layin' around here... somewhere.
1077752	So many rocks, so little ore… Your potential to increase your Mining skill is no longer enhanced.
1077751	You can almost smell the ore in the rocks here! Your ability to improve your Mining skill is enhanced in this area.

1077749	Amelia’s Toolbox
1077747	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Tinker. Talk to Amelia Youngstone in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you.
1077746	Nice going! You're not quite at Apprentice Tinkering yet, though, so you better get back to work. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make scissors up until 45 skill, and then switch to hammers. Also, don't forget that working here in my shop will let me give you tips so you can learn faster.
1077745	I’m disappointed that you aren’t interested in learning more about Tinkering. It’s really such a useful skill!<br><br>*Amelia smiles*<br><br>At least you know where to find me if you change your mind, since I rarely spend time outside of this shop.
1077744	Create new scissors and hammers while inside Amelia's workshop. Try making scissors up to 45 skill, the switch to making hammers until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center><br>Hello! I guess you're here to learn something about Tinkering, eh? You've come to the right place, as Tinkering is what I've dedicated my life to. <br><br>You'll need two things to get started: a supply of ingots and the right tools for the job. You can either buy ingots from the market, or go mine them yourself. As for tools, you can try making your own set of Tinker's Tools, or if you'd prefer to buy them, I have some for sale.<br><br>Working here in my shop will let me give you pointers as you go, so you'll be able to learn faster than anywhere else. Start off making scissors until you reach 45 tinkering skill, then switch to hammers until you've achieved 50. Once you've done that, come talk to me and I'll give you something for your hard work.
1077743	Since you’ve left Amelia’s workshop, she cannot give you advice. Your Tinkering learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077742	By tinkering inside of Amelia’s workshop, she is able to give you advice. This helps you hone your Tinkering skill faster than normal.
1077741	The Right Tool for the Job
1077740	Hammer of Hephaestus
1077739	I've been watching you get better and better as you've been smithing, and I have to say, you're a natural! It's a long road to being a Grandmaster Blacksmith, but I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it you'll get there someday. Let me give you one final piece of advice. If you're smithing just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.<br><br>Now that you're an Apprentice Blacksmith, I have something for you. While you were busy practicing, I was crafting this hammer for you. It's finely balanced, and has a bit of magic imbued within that will help you craft better items. However, that magic needs to restore itself over time, so you can only use it so many times per day. I hope you find it useful!
1077738	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Blacksmith. Return to George Hephaestus in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you.
1077737	You’re doing well, but you’re not quite there yet. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make daggers up until 45 skill, and then switch to maces. Also, don’t forget that using my forge and anvil will help you learn faster.
1077736	You're not interested in learning to be a smith, eh? I thought for sure that's why you were here. Oh well, if you change your mind, you can always come back and talk to me.
1077735	Create new daggers and maces using the forge and anvil in George's shop. Try making daggers up to 45 skill, the switch to making maces until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center><br>Hail, and welcome to my humble shop. I'm George Hephaestus, New Haven's blacksmith. I assume that you're here to ask me to train you to be an Apprentice Blacksmith. I certainly can do that, but you're going to have to supply your own ingots.<br><br>You can always buy them at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine your own. That way, any items you sell will be pure profit!<br><br>So, once you have a supply of ingots, use my forge and anvil here to create items. You'll also need a supply of the proper tools; you can use a smith's hammer, a sledgehammer or tongs. You can either make them yourself if you have the tinkering skill, or buy them from a tinker at the market.<br><br>Since I'll be around to give you advice, you'll learn faster here than anywhere else. Start off making daggers until you reach 45 blacksmithing skill, then switch to maces until you've achieved 50. Once you've done that, come talk to me and I'll give you something for your hard work.
1077734	You’re not using George’s forge and anvil any longer, and he cannot give you advice. Your Blacksmithing learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077733	By using George’s forge and anvil, he is able to give you advice as you create blacksmithing items. This helps you hone your Blacksmithing skill a bit faster than normal.
1077732	It’s Hammer Time!
1077731	Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Blacksmith profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>George Hephaestus teaches Blacksmithing. Obviously, knowing how to forge metal into weapons and armor is what defines a blacksmith. He can be found right next to me in this shop.<br><br>Amelia Youngstone teaches Tinkering. Tinkering complements the blacksmith skill as it allows you to craft your own blacksmithing tools, as well as other useful items. Amelia's workshop is Northwest of here in town.<br><br>Jacob Waltz teaches Mining. Without the knowledge of mining ore and smelting, a blacksmith will have to purchase ingots from the market. This greatly cuts into the profit making potential of Blacksmithing. You can find Jacob up in the hills to the South outside of town.<br><br>Kaelynna teaches Magery. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle. The sheer versatility of the Magery skill makes it highly useful to any blacksmith. Kaelynna resides North of here in the New Haven Mage School.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. Knowing how to handle a weapon is very important if you want to protect yourself from brigands and monsters. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not. Jockles can be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall which is East of here.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This skill complements Swordsmanship, as just knowing how to handle a weapon doesn't really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe. Alden can also be found in the Warrior's Guild Hall.<br><br>Good luck, and remember that a respected Blacksmith never tries to overcharge for services!

1077727	Bulwark Leggings
1077726	Well done, friend. While I know you understand Chivalry is its own reward, I would like to reward you with something that will protect you in battle. It was passed down to me when I was a lad. Now, I am passing it on you. It is called the Bulwark Leggings. Thank you for your service.
1077725	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Paladin. Return to Aelorn in New Haven to report your progress.
1077724	There are still more undead to lay to rest. You still have more to learn. Return to me once you have done so.
1077723	Farewell to you my friend. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Paladin.
1077722	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Consecrate your weapon, cast Divine Fury, and battle monsters there until you have raised your Chivalry skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail, friend. The life of a Paladin is a life of much sacrifice, humility, bravery, and righteousness. If you wish to pursue such a life, I have an assignment for you. Adventure east to Old Haven, consecrate your weapon, and lay to rest the undead that inhabit there.<br><br>Each ability a Paladin wishes to invoke will require a certain amount of "tithing points" to use. A Paladin can earn these tithing points by donating gold at a shrine or holy place. You may tithe at this shrine.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Paladin.
1077721	You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Paladin. Your Chivalry potential is not enhanced here.
1077720	Your Chivalry potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.
1077719	Cleansing Old Haven
1077718	Hail, brave knight! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Paladin profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Aelorn teaches Chivalry. I suggest talking to him first. Chivalry is the main ability of the Paladin. A Paladin can evoke a number of abilities that can improve his prowess on the battlefield.<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Sarsmea Smythe teaches Focus. The ability to balance yourself physically and mentally can help a Paladin stay fresh both in body and spirit.<BR><BR>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Paladin in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent’s strength and dexterity.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Resisting Spells which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Alefian is located at the New Haven Mage School. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<BR><BR>May your enemies feel the wrath of the righteous.

1077713	My Offer
1077712	A Dark Challenge
1077711	Well done! You're much better at parrying blows than you were when we first met. You should be proud of your newfound ability… and I bet your body is grateful to you as well.<br><br>*Tyl Ariadne laughs loudly at his own (mostly lame) joke*<br><br>Oh yes, I did promise you a shield if I thought you were worthy of having it, so here you go. My father made these shields for the guards who served my family faithfully for many years, and I just happen to have one that I can part with. You should find it useful as you explore the lands.<br><br>Good luck, and may the Virtues be your guide.
1077710	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior (for Parrying). Return to Tyl Ariadne in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077709	You're doing well, but in my opinion, I don't think you really want to continue on without improving your parrying skill a bit more. Go to Old Haven, to the East, and practice blocking blows with a shield.
1077708	It's your choice, obviously, but I'd highly suggest that you learn to parry before adventuring out into the world. Come talk to me again when you get tired of being beat on by your opponents.
1077707	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters, or simply let them hit you, while holding a shield or weapon until you have raised your Parrying skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Oh, hello. You probably want me to teach you how to parry, don't you?<br><br>Very well.<br><br>First, you'll need a weapon or shield. Obviously shields work best of all, but you can parry with a 2-handed weapon. Or if you're feeling particularly brave, a 1-handed weapon will do in a pinch.<br><br>I'd advise you to go to Old Haven, which you'll find to the East, and practice blocking incoming blows from the undead there. You'll learn quickly if you have more than one opponent attack you at the same time to practice parrying lots of blows at once. That's the quickest way to master the art of parrying.<br><br>If you manage to improve your skill enough, I have a shield that you might find useful. Come back to me when you've trained to apprentice level.
1077706	Your inner butterfly is tired. You're not particularly able to block incoming blows well. Your Parrying learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077705	You feel as light as a butterfly, as if you could block incoming blows easily. Your ability to hone your Parrying skill is enhanced in this area.
1077704	Thou and Thine Shield
1077703	Look who it is! I knew you could do it if you just had the discipline to apply yourself. It feels good to recover from battle so quickly, doesn't it? Just wait until you become a Grandmaster, it's amazing!<br><br>Please take this gift, as you've more than earned it with your hard work. It will help you recover even faster during battle, and provides a bit of protection as well.<br><br>You have so much more potential, so don't stop trying to improve your Focus now! Safe travels!
1077702	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic (for Focus). Return to Sarsmea Smythe in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you. 
1077701	Hello again. I see you've returned, but it seems that your Focus skill hasn't improved as much as it could have. Just head east, to Old Haven, and exert yourself physically and mentally as much as possible. To do this physically, engage in combat and move as quickly as you can. For exerting yourself mentally, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Return to me when you have gained enough Focus skill to be considered an Apprentice Stoic.
1077700	I'm disappointed. You have a lot of inner potential, and it would pain me greatly to see you waste that. Oh well. If you change your mind, I'll be right here.
1077699	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Expend stamina and mana until you have raised your Focus skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well, hello there. Don't you look like quite the adventurer!<br><br>You want to learn more about Focus, do you? I can teach you something about that, but first you should know that not everyone can be disciplined enough to excel at it. Focus is the ability to achieve inner balance in both body and spirit, so that you recover from physical and mental exertion faster than you otherwise would.<br><br>If you want to practice Focus, the best place to do that is east of here, in Old Haven, where you'll find an undead infestation. Exert yourself physically by engaging in combat and moving quickly. For testing your mental balance, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Go. Train hard, and you will find that your concentration will improve naturally. When you've improved your ability to focus yourself at an Apprentice level, come back to me and I shall give you something worthy of your new ability.
1077698	You feel like you don't even know yourself anymore! Your Focus learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077697	You feel much more attuned to yourself. Your ability to improve Focus skill is enhanced in this area.

1077692	By the Virtues, you've done it! Congratulations mate! You still have quite a ways to go if you want to perfect your knowledge of Anatomy, but I know you'll get there someday. Just keep at it.<br><br>In the meantime, here's a piece of armor that you might find useful. It's not fancy, but it'll serve you well if you choose to wear it.<br><br>Happy adventuring, and remember to keep your cranium separate from your clavicle!
1077691	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Healer (for Anatomy). Return to Andreas Vesalius in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.
1077690	I'm surprised to see you back so soon. You've still got a ways to go if you want to really understand the science of Anatomy. Head out to Old Haven and practice combat and healing yourself or other adventurers.
1077689	It's your choice, but I wouldn't head out there without knowing what makes those things tick inside! If you change your mind, you can find me right here dissecting frogs, cats or even the occasional unlucky adventurer.
1077688	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there, or heal yourself and other players, until you have raised your Anatomy skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met. You must be here to improve your knowledge of Anatomy. Well, you've come to the right place because I can teach you what you need to know. At least all you'll need to know for now. Haha!<br><br>Knowing about how living things work inside can be a very useful skill. Not only can you learn where to strike an opponent to hurt him the most, but you can use what you learn to heal wounds better as well. Just walking around town, you can even tell if someone is strong or weak or if they happen to be particularly dexterous or not.<BR><BR>If you're interested in learning more, I'd advise you to head out to Old Haven, just to the east, and jump into the fray. You'll learn best by engaging in combat while keeping you and your fellow adventurers healed, or you can even try sizing up your opponents.<br><br>While you're gone, I'll dig up something you may find useful.
1077687	You lose your ambition to learn about the body. Your Anatomy skill learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077686	You feel very willing to learn more about the body. Your ability to hone your Anatomy skill is enhanced in this area.

1077683	Hello there, friend. I see you've returned in one piece, and you're an Apprentice Healer to boot! You should be proud of your accomplishment, as not everyone has "the touch" when it comes to healing.<br><br>I can't stand to see such good work go unrewarded, so I have something I'd like you to have. It's not much, but it'll help you heal just a little faster, and maybe keep you alive.<br><br>Good luck out there, friend, and don't forget to help your fellow adventurer whenever possible!
1077681	Hail! 'Tis good to see you again. Unfortunately, you're not quite ready to call yourself an Apprentice Healer quite yet. Head back out to Old Haven, due east from here, and bandage up some wounds. Yours or someone else's, it doesn't much matter.
1077680	No? Are you sure? Well, when you feel that you're ready to practice your healing, come back to me. I'll be right here, fixing up adventurers and curing the occasional cold!
1077679	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Heal yourself and other players until you have raised your Healing skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Ah, welcome to my humble practice. I am Avicenna, New Haven's resident Healer. A lot of adventurers head out into the wild from here, so I keep rather busy when they come back bruised, bleeding, or worse.<br><br>I can teach you how to bandage a wound, sure, but it's not a job for the queasy! For some folks, the mere sight of blood is too much for them, but it's something you'll get used to over time. It is one thing to cut open a living thing, but it's quite another to sew it back up and save it from sure death. 'Tis noble work, healing.<br><br>Best way for you to practice fixing up wounds is to head east out to Old Haven and either practice binding up your own wounds, or practice on someone else. Surely they'll be grateful for the assistance.<br><br>Make sure to take enough bandages with you! You don't want to run out in the middle of a tough fight.
1077678	You feel as if you've seen enough blood to last a lifetime. Your Healing learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077677	You feel fresh and are eager to heal wounds. Your ability to improve your Healing skill is enhanced in this area.

1077674	Hey, good job killing those undead! Hopefully someone will come along and clean up the mess. All that blood and guts tends to stink after a few days, and when the wind blows in from the east, it can raise a mighty stink!<br><br>Since you performed valiantly, please take these arms and use them well. I've seen a few too many harvests to be running around out there myself, so you might as well take it.<br><br>There is a lot left for you to learn, but I think you'll do fine. Remember to keep your elbows in and stick'em where it hurts the most!
1077673	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior. Return to Alden Armstrong in New Haven to claim your reward.
1077672	You're making some progress, that I can tell, but you're not quite good enough to last for very long out there by yourself. Head back to Old Haven, to the east, and kill some more undead.
1077671	That's too bad. I really thought you had it in you. Well, I'm sure those undead will still be there later, so if you change your mind, feel free to stop on by and I'll help you the best I can.
1077670	Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there until you have raised your Tactics skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Knowing how to hold a weapon is only half of the battle. The other half is knowing how to use it against an opponent. It's one thing to kill a few bunnies now and then for fun, but a true warrior knows that the right moves to use against a lich will pretty much get your arse fried by a dragon.<br><br>I'll help teach you how to fight so that when you do come up against that dragon, maybe you won't have to walk out of there "OooOOooOOOooOO'ing" and looking for a healer.<br><br>There are some undead that need cleaning out in Old Haven towards the east. Why don't you head on over there and practice killing things?<br><br>When you feel like you've got the basics down, come back to me and I'll see if I can scrounge up an item to help you in your adventures later on.
1077669	You feel less able to absorb the lessons of combat. Your Tactics learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077668	You feel like practicing combat here would really help you learn to fight better. Your ability to raise your Tactics skill is enhanced in this area.

1077666	Jockles' Quicksword
1077665	Well, well, look at what we have here! You managed to do it after all. I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you came back in one piece, but since you did, I've got a little something for you.<br><br>This is fine blade that served me well in my younger days. Of course I've got much better swords at my disposal now, so I'll let you go ahead and use it under one condition. Take good care of it and treat it with the respect that a fine sword deserves.<br><br>You're one of the quickest learners I've seen, but you still have a ways to go. Keep at it, and you'll get there someday. Happy hunting, kid.
1077664	You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Swordsman. Return to Jockles in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you. Hopefully he'll be a little nicer this time!
1077663	*Jockles look you up and down*<br><br>Come on! You've got to work harder than that to get better. Now get out of here, go kill some more of those undead to the east in Old Haven, and don't come back till you've got some real skill.
1077662	Ha! I had a feeling you were a lily-livered pansy. You might have potential, but if you're scared by a few smelly undead, maybe it's better that you stay away from sharp objects. After all, you wouldn't want to hurt yourself swinging a sword. If you change your mind, I might give you another chance...maybe.
1077661	Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. While wielding your sword, battle monsters there until you have raised your Swordsmanship skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>*As you approach, you notice Jockles sizing you up with a skeptical look on his face*<br><br>I can see you want to learn how to handle a blade. It's a lot harder than it looks, and you're going to have to put in a lot of time and effort if you ever want to be half as good as I am.<br><br>I'll tell you what, kid, I'll help you get started, but you're going to have to do all the work if you want to learn something. East of here, outside of town, is Old Haven. It's been overrun with the nastiest sort of undead you've seen, which makes it the perfect place for you to turn that sloppy grin on your face into actual skill at handling a sword.<br><br>Make sure you have a sturdy Swordsmanship weapon in good repair before you leave. 'Tis no fun to travel all the way down there just to find out that you forgot your blade!<br><br>When you feel that you've cut down enough of those foul smelling things to learn to handle a blade without hurting yourself, come back to me. If I think you've improved enough, I'll give you something suited for a real warrior.
1077660	You feel less attuned to your blade. Your Swordsmanship learning potential is no longer enhanced.
1077659	You feel much more attuned to your blade. Your ability to hone your Swordsmanship skill is enhanced in this area.

1054083	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>Hello again. It is always good to see a friend of our colony.<BR><BR>Would you like me to process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you? I would be happy to do so if you will first undertake a couple tasks for me.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054082	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>I thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious. So full of flavor.<BR><BR>Hmm... if you would like, I could make you a friend of my colony. This would stop the warriors, workers, and queens of my colony from thinking you are an intruder, thus they would not attack you. In addition, as a friend of my colony I will process zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you.<BR><BR>To become a friend of my colony, I ask that you complete a couple tasks for me. These are the same tasks I will ask of you when you wish me to process zoogi fungus, by the way.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054081	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>It is good to see you again. I would offer to process some zoogi fungus for you, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054080	Thank you for that plant seed. Those have such wonderful flavor.
1054079	<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>Thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious.  <BR><BR>I would offer to make you a friend of my colony, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054078	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Ah good, you've returned. I will conclude our business by giving you any remaining rewards I owe you for aiding me.
1054077	<I>The Solen queen looks at you with a smile.</I><BR><BR>While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps you should free some room in your backpack before we proceed.
1054076	You have been given some gold.
1054075	You have been given some powder of translocation.
1054074	You have been given a bag of sending.
1054073	<I>The Solen queen smiles as she takes the zoogi fungus from you.</I><BR><BR>Wonderful! I greatly appreciate your help with these tasks. My plans are beginning to take shape ensuring that I will be the next Matriarch. But there is still much to be done until then.<BR><BR>You've done what I've asked of you and for that I thank you. Please accept this bag of sending and some powder of translocation as a reward. Oh, and I suppose I should give you some gold as well. Yes, yes. Of course.
1054072	Our arrangement was for 50 of the zoogi fungus. Please return to me when you have that amount.
1054071	I have not asked you to bring me any zoogi fungus, therefore I cannot accept these.
1054070	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Do you have the zoogi fungus?<BR><BR>If so, give them to me. Otherwise, go gather some and then return to me.
1054069	Gather zoogi fungus until you have 50 of them, then give them to the ambitious queen you are helping.
1054068	<I>The Solen queen looks pleased to see you.</I><BR><BR>Splendid! You've done quite well in reducing my competition to become the next Matriarch. Now I must ask that you gather some zoogi fungus for me. I must practice processing it into powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I believe the amount we agreed upon earlier was 50. Please return when you have that amount and then give them to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.
1054067	You've completed your task of slaying solen queens. Return to the ambitious queen who asked for your help.
1054066	<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 5 queens from my colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Remember, by the way, that queens from the other solen colony and infiltrator queens do not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054065	Black Solen Queens killed:
1054064	Red Solen Queens killed:
1054063	Kill 5 black solen queens.
1054062	Kill 5 red solen queens.
1054061	<I>The Solen queen smiles as you decide to help her.</I><BR><BR>Excellent. We'll worry about the zoogi fungus later - start by eliminating 5 queens from my colony.<BR><BR>That part's important, by the way; they must be queens from my colony. Killing queens from the other solen colony does little to help me become Matriarch of this colony and will not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Oh, and none of those nasty infiltrator queens either. They perform a necessary duty, I suppose, spying on the other colony. I fail to see why that couldn't be left totally to the warriors, though. Nevertheless, they do not count as well.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.
1054060	<I>The Solen queen considers you eagerly for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes, I think you could be of use. Normally, of course, I would handle these things on my own, but these are busy times. Much to do, much to do. And besides, if I am to one day become the Matriarch, then it will be good to have experience trusting others to carry out various tasks for me. Yes.<BR><BR>That is my plan, you see - I will become the next Matriarch. Our current Matriarch is fine and all, but she won't be around forever. And when she steps down, I intend to be the next in line. Ruling others is my destiny, you see.<BR><BR>What I ask of you is quite simple. First, I need you to remove some of the - well - competition, I suppose. Though I dare say most are hardly competent to live up to such a title. I'm referring to the other queens of this colony, of course. My dear sisters, so to speak. If you could remove 5 of them, I would be most pleased. *sighs* By remove, I mean kill them. Don't make that face at me - this is how things work in a proper society, and ours has been more proper than most since the dawn of time. It's them or me, and whenever I give it any thought, I'm quite sure I'd prefer it to be them.<BR><BR>I also need you to gather some zoogi fungus for me - 50 should do the trick.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?
1054059	<I>The Solen queen considers you for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Hmmm... I could perhaps benefit from your assistance, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Return to me when you complete whatever it is that you're working on and maybe I can still put you to good use.
1054058	You begin recording your completed notes on a bit of parchment.
1054057	You complete your examination of this bizarre Egg Nest. The Naturalist will undoubtedly be quite interested in these notes!
1054056	You notice something very odd about this Solen Egg Nest. You begin taking notes.
1054055	Solen Nests Studied :
1054054	You have completed your study of this Solen Egg Nest. You put your notes away.
1054053	<I>The Naturalist looks at you with a friendly expression.</I><BR><BR>I see you've returned with information for me. While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment. Perhaps you'd better free up some room before we get to discussing your reward.
1054052	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his scribbled notes.</I><BR><BR>Greetings!<BR><BR>If you're interested in helping out a scholar of some repute, I do have some work that I could use some assistance with.<BR><BR>You seem a little preoccupied with another task right now, however. Perhaps you should finish whatever it is that has your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.
1054051	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with an ecstatic look upon his face.</I><BR><BR>Oh my! These notes you've brought me - they say you have information on the Secret Solen Egg Nest? I've heard many tales of this secret store of special Solen Eggs, but there are many missing gaps in my notes concerning it.<BR><BR>The notes you've made here will most certainly advance my understanding of this mysterious breed of creatures!<BR><BR>Considering the amazing effort you put into your work, I feel as if I should give you something extra special as a bonus. Hrmm...<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce rare mutant strains of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>I've given a few of her seeds out to various apprentices - but I usually keep her very rare stock all for myself: the black, white and fire red seeds. They're quite amazing looking! However, since you've done such a fine job for me, I'll present you with one of these rare seeds.<BR><BR>Once again, my thanks to you! Now I really must get back to studying these notes! Take care, my fine apprentice, and come back if you wish to help me further!
1054050	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a pleased expression on his face.</I><BR><BR>Ah! Thank you, my goodly apprentice! These notes you have gathered will no doubt assist me in my understanding of these fascinating Solen creatures.<BR><BR>Now, since you've done such a fine job, I feel that I should give you a little reward.<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>As a reward for your fine efforts, I present you with this strange rare seed. Which reminds me, I still need to compile my notes on Solen dietary habits. They are voracious seed eaters, those Solen Matriarchs!<BR><BR>In any case, I must get back to my notes now. I give you my thanks once more, and bid a good day to you my little apprentice! If you wish to help me out again, just say the word.
1054049	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a frustrated look on his face.</I><BR><BR>Haven't you finished the task I appointed you yet? Gah! It's so difficult to find a good apprentice these days.<BR><BR>Remember, you must first find an entrance to the Solen Hive. Once inside, I need you to examine the Solen Egg Nests for me. When you have studied all four nests, you should have enough information to earn yourself a reward.<BR><BR>Now go on, away with you! I have piles of notes from other more helpful apprentices that I still need to study!
1054048	You have studied enough Solen Egg Nests to gather a fair amount of useful information. Return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054047	You glance at the Egg Nest, realizing you've already studied this one.
1054046	You abandon your study of the Solen Egg Nest without gathering the needed information.
1054045	You begin studying the Solen Egg Nest to gather information.
1054044	Find an entrance to the Solen Hive, and search within for the Solen Egg Nests. Each Nest must be studied for some time without a break in concentration in order to gather useful information.<BR><BR>Once you have completed your study of the Nests, return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.
1054043	Ah! This is splendid news! Each time an assistant travels into the Solen Hive to gather information for me, I feel as if I am one step closer to some grand discovery. Though I felt the same way when I was certain that Terathans had the ability to change their shape to resemble various fruits and vegetables - a point on which I am certain further study of the beasts will prove correct.<BR><BR>In any case, I cannot thank you enough! Please return to me when you have studied all the Solen Egg Nests hidden within the Solen Hive.
1054042	<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes, regarding you with a hopeful look in his eyes.</I><BR><BR>Um..yes..excuse me. I was wondering if you could offer me a bit of assistance. You see, I'm a naturalist of some repute - a gentleman and a scholar if you will - primarily interested in the study of insects and arachnids. While I've written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it? Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously protected by the Solen workers. If you would be so kind as to assist me, I would ask that you travel into the Solen Hive and inspect each of the Solen Egg Nests that reside within. You will have to spend some time examining each Nest before you have gathered enough information. Once you are done, report back to me and I will reward you as best as I can for your valiant efforts!<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?

1077177	
1077176	
1077175	Your…!
1077174	Your witness, sir.
1077173	Your Honor? Objection?
1077172	Your Honor?
1077171	Your Honor, the Prosecution would like to submit People’s Exhibit the Second at this time.
1077170	Your Honor, the Prosecution is most distressed by the behavior of the Defense.
1077169	Your Honor, surely you will not…?
1077168	Your Honor, surely Mr. Casca is an expert in his field and capable of evaluating his own case?
1077167	Your Honor, my witness seems to be absent.
1077166	Your Honor, I…
1077165	Your Honor, I object to this, and…
1077164	Your Honor, from the moment I entered the custody of the courts I've had no chance of defending myself.
1077163	Your Honor! Speculation!
1077162	YOUR HONOR! Please!
1077161	Your Honor! My client hath done none of these things!
1077160	Your Honor! Calls for speculation on the part of the witness! On my part!
1077159	Your Honor!
1077158	Your Hon…
1077157	You there! Halt!
1077156	You see, ladies and gentlemen, Liane lived in Papua, a territory of Britannia in the Lost Lands, and the first city to suffer under the sudden onslaught of the Ophidian army.
1077155	You sat there, armed with a crossbow, and watched a girl get killed, doing nothing?!
1077153	Yet, you see my friends, Liane died under an Ophidian's blade, true! But it was a Man who sealed her fate.
1077152	Yet here I stand now, a citizen, yearning to do Justice by the laws and codes that have built our great society.
1077151	Yes?
1077150	Yes.
1077149	Yes, Your Honor.
1077148	Yes, Your Honor, unless I were to represent myself before the court.
1077147	Yes, Your Honor, just a moment more.
1077146	Yes, Your Honor!
1077145	Yes, there is a specific clause extending the definition.
1077144	Yes sir, I am. What’s left of it at least.
1077143	Would the jury foreman please stand.
1077142	Why, the door behind which Inu the Crone lay prisoner!
1077141	Why art thou here, Nick?
1077140	Why aren’t questions being asked?
1077139	Wholeheartedly.
1077138	Which incident is that?
1077137	whether it ought to be judged Treason or other Felony.
1077136	Where, I ask, were the soldiers when Papua was attacked?
1077135	Where, I ask, were the mages to protect the barriers around our cities?
1077134	Where, I ask, was this vaunted Royal Council, that so easily passes judgment, in our time of need?
1077133	When you say neighbors, whom do you mean?
1077132	When you say barriers…
1077131	What?
1077130	What the jury must decide, though, is the validity of the Kingdom’s complaint.
1077129	What the government of Britannia wishes is for me to die, not to receive Justice.
1077128	What of this “blackrock” then? These strange magics and a rogue Ophidian queen?
1077127	What happened then?
1077126	What happened then?
1077125	Well, well… well. So… you saw this scared, little, child of a girl run into this building all by herself?
1077124	Well I shall tell thee!
1077123	We’d had our fair share of trouble with the neighbors, but it’d been right calm since we’d become a part of the Kingdom proper.
1077122	We will prove that Ricardo has committed High Treason, and we will demonstrate the law to which he will be held.
1077120	We will further show that Ricardo, in doing so, invoked a war upon our shores like none seen in recent memory.
1077119	We judge his crime Treason most High.
1077118	We have.
1077117	We define this instance as: "A willful act that results in great loss of life and property."
1077116	Wait, is this the same woman who just willfully obstructed the court?
1077115	Very well, the charges of Theft and Conspiracy are hereby dropped.
1077114	Very well, let the record show that we hath concluded opening statements.
1077113	Very well, and again, good afternoon to you all.
1077112	Ah, Your Honor, I believe he is referring to Ricardo picking a lock for some mercenaries.
1077111	Two, Levy war against the Sovereign in their Realm; or adhere to the Sovereign’s enemies in their Realm; giving them aid or comfort in their Realm or elsewhere, or
1077110	Three, Counterfeit the Royal Seal; or any of the Sovereign’s money, or
1077109	Thou mayest do so.
1077108	Those snakes and spiders, ya ‘know, the monsters.
1077107	This is unfortunate, dost thou have any further witnesses?
1077106	This is the Court of Truth, Mr. Ricardo, dost thou so swear?
1077105	This has also been corroborated by a witness who had personal dealings with Ricardo.
1077104	This government has given itself the power to destroy any one of us by simply rewriting laws.
1077103	This court is now open for the trial of criminal cases with and without jury.
1077102	This court is now in session. Please be seated.
1077101	Third, that a band of brigands did assault the transport carriage of Ricardo during his relocation to Yew.
1077100	They were all over the docks, so I climbed a tree. Turned out they never found me up there.
1077099	They submit to you, as do I, as does Britannia herself, that Ricardo’s actions resulted in the needless deaths of thousands.
1077098	They do not, for they cannot.
1077097	Then we will proceed to closing statements. Mr. Casca?
1077096	Then thou mayest proceed.
1077095	Theft, namely of a foreign national treasure.
1077094	The Royal Council has determined that the acts Ricardo committed amount to High Treason.
1077093	The record shows the findings as People’s Exhibit the First, and that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.
1077092	The record does so show.
1077091	The Prosecution wishes to submit the findings of Justice Edgar, juge d’instruction for this case, as People’s Exhibit the First.
1077090	The Prosecution wishes to dismiss the charges of Theft and Conspiracy against the defendant.
1077089	The prosecution will show beyond any reasonable doubt that Ricardo’s theft of the Scion’s Zenith, an artifact of great importance to the Ophidians, was the direct cause of the war.
1077087	The Prosecution has submitted its case to the court quite plainly.
1077086	The Prosecution has failed, you see, to actually prove a crime was committed.
1077085	The Prosecution has failed to establish a link between the assault on the prison transport and any conspiracy on the part of the defendant.
1077084	The People calls Nicholas to the stand
1077083	The People calls Hudson of Papua to the stand.
1077082	The Ophidians hunted down every man, woman, and child they could find in that city, and slaughtered them without mercy.
1077081	The Ophidians and Terathans, you mean?
1077080	The man you see sitting before thee is but a pitiful pawn in a game of chess.
1077079	The magic ones, you know, that protect cities. All of ‘em have ‘em.
1077078	The least I can be allowed is a chance to speak. Is this not fair?
1077077	the Justices shall tarry without any going to Judgement of the Treason till the Cause be shewed and declared before the Sovereign and his Council,
1077076	The jury will now decide the facts of this case, and render a verdict of Guilty or Innocent for the charge of High Treason.
1077075	The jury will disregard testimony concerning Inu the Crone - irrelevance.
1077074	The findings of the Investigating Magistrate are not a matter for debate. Continue.
1077073	The findings are:
1077072	The Defense shall refute the claims of the Prosecution, and prove, or at least provide some reasonable shred of doubt, that Ricardo is innocent of the crimes attributed him.
1077071	The Defendant, Ricardo, has pleaded Not Guilty to the following charges:
1077070	The Defendant will remain silent.
1077069	The crown thing? Sure. Broke it up for for the rares: gold, jewels, you know.
1077068	The court shall disregard, and the Defense will keep observations of the Court to themselves.
1077067	The court finds the defendant innocent. Mr. Ricardo, you are free to go.
1077066	The court finds the defendant guilty of High Treason.
1077065	The conditions are not only met, but are exceeded.
1077064	The clerk shall read the charges against the Defendant and report his pleas.
1077063	The charge of Theft, at this point, may unduly influence the decision on the charge of Treason. Also, the charge of Conspiracy cannot be substantiated.
1077062	The Act allows the Council to define new and specific instances of Treason.
1077061	That's immaterial - they're monsters.
1077060	That’s… it?
1077059	That’s right.
1077058	That was acceptable.
1077057	That trust tells me that you must act in accordance with those laws. I have laid them plainly before you.
1077056	That they decide only upon the facts of this case.
1077054	That man, ladies and gentlemen, is seated before us.
1077053	That man is Ricardo, the so-called legendary thief.
1077052	Thank you. Your Honor, I call my next witness to the stand.
1077051	Thank you. Not bad for a thief, eh?
1077050	Thank you. Is there any additional text concerning the definition of High Treason?
1077049	Thank you.
1077048	Thank you.
1077047	Thank you, Your Honor.
1077046	Thank you, sir.
1077045	Thank you, Lord Francesco.
1077044	Thank you, I’m finished.
1077043	Thank you Hudson.
1077042	Tell me, then, did Ricardo not aid an old woman locked in a dungeon? Surely the Council is aware of this incident?
1077041	Sustained. Mr. Beauregard, this man is not on trial. Change your line of questioning.
1077040	Sustained.
1077039	Sustained!
1077038	Sure. I’m a fence.
1077037	Stop! Stop I say!
1077036	Soon we were all running for the shore – figured we could swim if we couldn’t get through the trees.
1077035	Soon enough the guards were down, and the barriers around the town, they just weren’t working.
1077034	Someone help me catch her!
1077033	Some may be confused by the elegant words you heard Lord Francesco speak. Please don’t be.
1077032	So, it seemeth my friend Mr. Casca wisheth to establish a most sad tale of woe! Is that it, Hudson?
1077031	So noted.
1077030	Sir, may I inquire as to your profession?
1077029	She lived with her family in a sleepy little village, and lived a humble yet blissful life.
1077028	Second, that Ricardo committed, and did in fact admit to, the theft of the Scion’s Zenith.
1077027	Right, then.
1077026	Ricardo.
1077025	Ricardo did not wield the bardiche that cut short Liane’s life.
1077024	Proceed.
1077023	Proceed.
1077021	Please read it.
1077020	Please answer.
1077019	Overruled. That was for clarification. The witness may answer.
1077018	Our only wish is that the jury carefully hear all the evidence presented from this point forward.
1077017	Order!
1077016	One, that Ricardo is the same Ricardo accused in the matter of this trial.
1077015	One, Compass or imagine the death of our lord the Sovereign; or the Sovereign’s companion; or their heir, or
1077014	One moment Mr. Ricardo.
1077013	One moment it was quiet, the next the jungle was a full of ‘em. They were everywhere.
1077012	On the charge of High Treason, how does the jury find the defendant?
1077011	Oh? And why was that?
1077010	Oh.
1077009	Oh, well then, thank you.
1077008	Oh no! We fought ‘em, we did. I had me trusty crossbow at me side.
1077007	Objection, Your Honor!
1077006	Objection! Leading the witness!
1077005	Objection! Hearsay!
1077004	Objection noted. Please proceed.
1077003	Now this young lady was kind, generous, altogether virtuous, and quite beloved of the townspeople.
1077002	Nothing further, Mr. Ricardo?
1077001	Nor the ones that destroyed the thousands of lives lost during the war.
1077000	No, Your Honor. The Prosecution rests.
1076999	No, Your Honor. Motion to delay?
1076998	No, Your Honor.
1076997	No, today, Justice cannot yield to mercy, even as Compassion was never shown to all those who paid the price for Ricardo’s crimes.
1076996	No! Instead, we found them building machines of horrible power deep within the earth.
1076995	No!
1076994	Never met her in my life, Your Honor. Although…
1076993	My people, the Elves of Heartwood, were long separated from our brethren the Britannians.
1076992	My friends, there is no body and there is, no, crime.
1076991	My friends, I walk amongst you as a stranger to your culture, and to your ways.
1076990	My defender seems to be asleep.
1076988	Mr. Ricardo? Thou understandeth that ye are in no position to dictate the course of this affair?
1076987	Mr. Ricardo, you are hereby remanded to the State for execution.
1076986	Mr. Ricardo, I doubt you comprehend the ramifications of representing thyself.
1076985	Mr. Ricardo, dost thou feel that you canst more truly represent thyself than those who have been, or may be appointed in thine behalf?
1076984	Mr. Casca?
1076983	Mr. Casca, your next witness?
1076982	Mr. Casca, thou mayest begin.
1076981	Mr. Casca, of the charges levied against me, which have you failed to demonstrate?
1076980	Mr. Casca, are the Ophidian lands under the control of the Britannian government?
1076979	Mr. Beauregard?
1076978	Mr. Beauregard, does this line of inquiry have a point?
1076977	MR. BEAUREGARD!
1076976	Mr. Beauregard had not even arranged any witnesses to testify on my behalf.
1076975	Moving on. Mr. Casca?
1076974	Mmhm… and you saw that snake heading towards her?
1076973	Met ‘em? We’re good buddies! Hey Ricardo!
1076972	Members of the jury shall remain seated, all else are free to go.
1076971	May the mercy of our True Sovereign be upon us.
1076970	Lord Francesco, please.
1076969	Lord Francesco, could you introduce yourself briefly?
1076968	Lord Francesco was kind to point out that strange and curious addition to the Treason Act.
1076967	Like I said, he told me he got it from the snakes.
1076966	Liane was no exception.
1076965	Liane suffered that instant of agony alone, as she watched her father fall before her eyes, yet in all the carnage managed to escape meeting her family’s fate.
1076964	Let the record show that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.
1076963	Ladies and gentlemen, I am not a smart man, and definitely not a noble one.
1076962	Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I’d like to begin by telling you a story about a young girl named Liane.
1076961	Lacking any further witnesses, I call Mr. Casca to the stand.
1076960	It went in. It was in there for a long time, and then I heard a scream. It’d gotten pretty quiet by then.
1076959	It was fast, that’s what it was.
1076958	It is my hope you will answer Justice this day with a resounding voice.
1076957	it is accorded, That if any other Case, supposed Treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any Justices,
1076955	Is the Defense prepared?
1076954	Is that at issue? I did not…
1076953	Is that all, Mr. Beauregard?
1076952	Irregular, but I can allow it.
1076951	Inu… the what? Who?
1076950	Inu the Crone, kidnapped off the streets of Britain, held against her will, this man saved her!
1076949	Instead, the terrified child sought shelter in the depths of a dark cellar, hidden, as best she could, in the impossibly tight space between a few water barrels.
1076948	Instead they left their nation defenseless, and now, in their haste to cover their cowardice, they lay the blame on me.
1076947	Innocent.
1076946	Indeed. So the Ophidians had no opposition?
1076945	Indeed.
1076944	Indeed, Your Honor.
1076943	Indeed, Your Honor, quite prepared!
1076942	If it pleases the court, my defender seems to be drunk, as well.
1076941	If a man slay a beast, even outside the Kingdom’s borders, can he not take whatever he finds?
1076940	I’m sorry?
1076939	I’m done with this man.
1076938	I yield the witness to my friend, Mr. Beauregard.
1076937	I would like to put forward a motion of no confidence in my Defense, Your Honor.
1076936	I want to tell you that the Ophidians withdrew and returned to their lairs, content with their mayhem.
1076935	I want to tell you that she remained hidden and safe in that cellar.
1076934	I thought she’d hid good, was sure of it, hoped so at least. But then I saw one of them snakes sniffing around the door.
1076933	I take stolen stuff and pass it on, or sell it to others.
1076932	I see. Who gave you that crown?
1076931	I see. Still, we must arrange the representation of the defendant, or reconvene when Mr. Beauregard is in a position to fulfill his capacities.
1076930	I remind the court that testimony given as part of a plea bargain is perfectly admissible.
1076929	I plead for my life, but, oh my friends, I plead more for Justice.
1076928	I only wish to convey the horror this child must have endured in the darkness, while the screams of the dying echoed all around her.
1076927	I mean, please ask thyself that question, and consider this case most carefully.
1076926	I have received it.
1076925	I have always respected the great Britannian legal system. I have placed my trust in it.
1076924	I got caught fencing some jewels. My testimony is part of the plea bargain.
1076922	I do, Your Honor.
1076921	I do not understand the cunning ways of law, nor the subtleties of court.
1076920	I did.
1076919	I did, in fact, take the Scion’s Zenith from the Ophidians. Please notice I did not say “stole.”
1076918	I cannot tell you. I doubt they will ever tell you.
1076917	I am handing a copy of the Treason Act to the clerk at this time.
1076916	I am Francesco, Treasurer of the Royal Council. I am here representing their will today.
1076915	I am a necessary sacrifice. I am the scapegoat: the man who suffers their sins.
1076914	I agree, Your Honor and…
1076913	Hudson, are you from the town of Papua?
1076912	How, ye may ask, might a man, a thief, in fact, be innocent?
1076911	How so?
1076910	How do you find the defendant?
1076909	How could I, by myself, have incited a war when the "crime" I committed was so minor?
1076908	How can I have stolen something, when the Ophidians do not recognize our own laws?
1076907	How are we to know it was not all a lie? A mere excuse?
1076906	Hmm… Save for the serious nature of the charges I might have already ordered this case retried.
1076905	His actions have resulted in the deaths of thousands, and extraordinary loss to the Kingdom.
1076904	High Treason, for inciting the Ophidian War.
1076903	Hey, Nick.
1076902	Here… alone, in shock, drenched in tears and sweat and blood, the poor girl hid.
1076901	Her father was an innkeeper, and as such, she often had the opportunity to greet travelers and serve as a hostess for their visitors.
1076900	Hehehehe.
1076899	Heard it came from the snake people.
1076898	He committed a crime, and, through his negligence, compounded the crime in an incalculable way.
1076897	Have you reached a verdict on the charge?
1076896	Have you ever met this man, Ricardo?
1076895	Has Ricardo’s crime met these conditions?
1076894	Guilty.
1076893	Guards!
1076892	Good afternoon. The clerk shall announce counsel.
1076891	Good afternoon, Your Honor. Might I say Her Ladyship looketh well today?
1076889	Get this fool woman out of here!
1076888	Friends, Britannians, Countrymen!
1076887	Fourth, that the theft of the Scion’s Zenith was an instigating factor in the sudden uprising of the Ophidians.
1076886	Four, Kill any member of the Royal Court; or the Sovereign’s Justices; or the Royal Council while in the pursuit of their duties
1076885	Forgive me, Your Honor.
1076884	Forgive me, my friends, for this graphic rendition.
1076883	For the ramifications could be dire.
1076882	Finally, I would like to call Luiz the Guard to the stand, who will testify concerning the assault on Ricardo’s transport earlier this month.
1076881	Excuse me?
1076880	Even after the so-called crime has been committed, as they have done to me.
1076879	Er, yes, Your Honor.
1076878	Er, well, yes Your Honor.
1076877	Er, did Ricardo tell you where he obtained the crown?
1076876	Dost thou wish to explain?
1076875	Does the Defense wish to accede?
1076874	Do you know where he got it?
1076873	Did you see anything while you were up there?
1076872	Did you listen carefully? That’s right. They, the Royal Council, are allowed to define Treason however they wish.
1076871	Did we see the Ophidians withdraw after that peaceful move?
1076870	Did we not turn over a replicated copy, which they readily accepted, convinced of its realness?
1076869	Did I send wave after wave of invading marauders into the Ophidians lair seeking treasure? No.

1050022	For your valor in combating the devourer, you have been awarded a golden skull.
1050021	Well done brave soul.   I shall summon the beast to the circle of stones just South-East of here.  Take great care - the beast takes many forms.  Now hurry...
1050020	<I>Victoria turns to you and smiles...</I><BR><BR>Chyloth, eh?  He is the ferry man of lake <I>Mortis</I>, beyond which lies the nest of the <I>The Dark Father</I> - the fountainhead of all the evil that you see around you here.<BR><BR>800 and some years ago, my sisters and I persuaded the ferry man Chyloth to take us across the lake to battle the <I>The Dark Father</I>.  My party was utterly destroyed, except for me.

They are gained in a variety of different ways, including Animal Taming, trading, crafting, or just handing a pile of gold to an out-of-work mercenary.  All players may have up to five followers.  On top of this, some individual followers may count as more than one follower.  For example, a dragon counts as three followers, a hireling counts as two, and a horse counts as one.  This means you could have a dragon and two horses, or two mercenaries and one horse, or any combination thereof.<br><br>Note: Some powerful creatures, such as dragons, also require Animal Taming and Animal Lore to control, regardless of the number of followers you have.

1049588	House Refresh Type:
1049587	To keep a house from collapsing, it must be periodically refreshed.  The actual refresh process is different, depending on the refresh type of the house.  Here is a list of all the different refresh types along with information on how a house enters the given refresh state.<BR><BR><U>Condemned</U><BR><BR>A house will be condemned when the house owner either places or accepts the transfer of a new home, or if the owner's player account becomes inactive.  Condemnation will affect all houses on all shards (except in the case of a transfer or newly placed house, in which case the last house that was acquired will not be condemned, but rather will enter into the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state. See below for details.).<BR><BR>Although the contents of a condemned house are still accessible as they normally would, the house cannot be refreshed.  In addition to not being refreshable, the house will collapse within 2 days of being condemned.  If a house entered the <I>condemned</I> status because the house owner's account became inactive, the house(s) may be uncondemned by the house owner, by openeing the front door.  Otherwise, the house can only be uncondemned by transferring or re-deeding it.<BR><BR><U>Grandfathered</U><BR><BR>These houses will be need to be manually refreshed by the house owner, one of the co-owners or house friends.  Refreshing is done by simply opening the front door.<BR><BR><U>Automatic</U><BR><BR>When an account has only one house across all shards, that house enters the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state.  These houses will never decay, unless they enter the <I>Condemned</I> state for any reason.  These houses will never have to be manually refreshed.
1049586	Refreshing Houses
1049585	Having this house transferred to you will <a href = "?ForceTopic97">condemn</a> any and all of your other houses that you may have.

1049560	The Gate Spell is a seventh (7th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Sullfurous Ash</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to open a magical gate to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and a temporary gate will open.  The gate will remain open only for a few moments before it closes again.  Anyone wishing to travel through the gate, need only to walk into the gate and they will be transported. <BR><BR>As long as your pets are following you, they too will be transported when they walk into a gate.
1049559	The Gate Spell
1049558	The Recall Spell is a fourth (4th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to instantly teleport to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and you will be transported.  Keep in mind that this spell only transports the caster - any pets (unless they are bonded) or friends that are with you, will be left behind.
1049557	The Recall Spell
1049556	The Mark Spell is a sixth (6th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any rune (which can be <a href = "?33">purchased</a> from most magic shops) to <i>mark</i> that rune with your current location.  If the spell is successful, the rune will be permanently marked.  You can mark over an already marked rune, which replaces your new location with the old location.<BR><BR>Once a rune is marked, you can use either the <a href = "?94">Recall</a> or the <a href = "?96">Gate</a> spell to travel back to the marked location, instantaneously.
1049555	The Mark Spell
1049554	There are three (3) magic spells that can be used to transport yourself and your friends to anywhere in the world - instantaneously.<BR><BR><U><a href = "?94">The Mark Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This spell is the basis for the other travels spells. It allows you mark a location that you wish to return to at a later time, using one of the other two travel spells. <a href = "?94">more...</a><BR><BR><U><a href = "?95">The Recall Spell</a></U><BR><BR>This is the easiest of the two transport spells to cast.

1049552	The Nightsight Spell is a 1st circle spell, and can be cast by nearly everyone.  The effect of the spell is such, that the person who is targeted by the spell will be able to see in the dark.  This spell is especially useful in dungeons and dark woods.<BR><BR>The two <a href = "?37">reagents</a>  that are required for this spell, are Spider's Silk and Sulfurous Ash.
1049551	The Nightsight Spell
1049550	Treasure maps are pieces of paper that will show the location of a buried treasure somewhere in the land.<BR><BR>To find this treasure, a few simple steps must be followed.<BR><BR><U>1.</U> Use the <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map to decode the map. Once a map is decoded, it will no longer have the word "tattered" in it's title.  This is a handy thing to know if you want to find out if a map has been previously decoded or not.  This is important, since only the person that decoded the map, can actually dig up the treasure.<BR><BR><U>2.</U> Finding the treasure is a rather simple procedure on youthful treasuremaps.  You will need some sort of digging device (like a shovel or a pickaxe) to unearth the treasure.  Once you have secured your tools, you will need to open the map (double click) and take a look at it.  Use your <a href = "?14">Radar Map</a> to see if you can somewhat figure out where the treasure might be by comparing the drawing on the map and the picture from the the overhead Radar.<BR><BR>If you are having trouble making out the area,  the best thing to do is to find a patch of grass or dirt (out in the woods perhaps), and start digging.  Digging is easily accomplished by using the "Dig for Treasure" <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map.<BR><BR>Once you select the digging option, target the place on the ground that you wish to dig at.  If you are not at the correct spot, you will get help message telling you which direction to move in.  Follow the directions and keep digging until you find the chest.<BR><BR><U>3.</U> Once the chest has emerged, the treasure's guardians will appear.  You must defeat all of the treasure's guardians before you can loot the chest.<BR><BR>Good luck.

1049340	Uzeraan hands you a finely crafted sword which you immediately place into your backpack.
1049339	Your pack is too full to carry the sword that Uzeraan wishes to give you.  Talk to Uzeraan again when you have enough room in your pack and he will give you the sword at that time.
1049338	You find a vial of blood, but can't pick it up because your pack is too full.  Come back when you have more room in your pack.
1049337	<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer!  I see you've learned how to cash checks.  Wonderful!  Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land.  For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Haven, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Britain or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure.  So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself.  Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia!  We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow!  May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.
1049336	Locate the Haven Bank (use the teleporter in Uzeraan's Mansion if necessary), which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of Uzeraan's Mansion.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.
1049335	<I>As you hand Uzeraan the final reagent, he nods at you with approval and starts searching through the pockets of his robe...<BR><BR>After a short while he hands you a small pouch...</I><BR><BR>There you are.  Your contract of employment with me has expired and so here is your pay.  2000 gold in the form of a check and a magical sextant that will help you find <a href = "?ForceTopic47">Moongates</a> and Banks.<BR><BR>Before you can actually spend the money I have given you, however, you must <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a>.<BR><BR>I have recalibrated the teleporter to take you to the Haven <a href="?ForceTopic38">Bank</a>.  Step onto the teleporter to be taken to the bank, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of here.<BR><BR>Thank you for all your help friend.  I hope we shall meet each other again in the future.<BR><BR>Farewell.
1049334	Head <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of here (or use the Horn of Retreat) to return to Uzeraan's Mansion and deliver the bone to Uzeraan.
1049333	<I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take this magical silver sword to aid you in your battle.  Silver weapons will damage the undead twice as much as your regular weapon.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.
1049332	You have the vial of blood!<BR><BR>Return to Uzeraan's mansion and hand him the vial.
1049331	You take a vial of blood from the chest and put it in your pack.
1049330	You have been ambushed! Fight for your honor!!!
1049329	<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some bandages as well as some healing potions.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!
1049328	NullString.
1049327	You have acquired the <I>Fertile Dirt</I>!<BR><BR>Return to the mansion (<a href = "?ForceTopic13">North-East</a> of the Dryad's Grove) and hand it to Uzeraan.
1049326	<I>The Dryad watches hungrily as you approach, giving you an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You explain that Uzeraan has sent you for a quantity of fertile dirt.  With a wide grin and in a slightly hoarse voice she replies...</I><BR><BR><I>Fertile Dirt</I>, eh?  Well, I have a few patches here...but what have you brought me in return?  Came empty-handed did you?  That's unfortunate indeed... but since you were sent by my dear friend Uzeraan, I supposed I could oblige you.<BR><BR><I>The Dryad digs around in the ground and hands you a patch of Fertile Dirt.<BR><BR>With a smile she goes back to her work...</I>
1049325	<I>Uzeraan carefully unravels the scroll and begins to read...after a short while his face lights up with a smile and he speaks to you...</I><BR><BR>This is wonderful, friend!  For your troubles I've given you a treasure map I had laying about, along with a shovel to <a href = "?ForceTopic91">dig up the treasure</a>.  Feel free to find the treasure at your leisure.<BR><BR>Now let us get back to the business of this scroll. The only trouble, is that this scroll calls for some special ingredients that I do not have on hand.<BR><BR>Though it may involve some danger, I will ask of you to find these reagents for me.  <BR><BR>There are three reagents I need to complete the spell.<BR><BR>The first thing I need is some <I>Fertile Dirt</I>.<BR><BR>There lives a Dryad on this island who I know would have such a thing on hand.  I have recalibrated the teleporter to transport you to the Dryad's grove, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of this mansion.<BR><BR>Tell her Uzeraan sent you, and she should cooperate.<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry.  I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>.  Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this mansion.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me or any of my mansion guards the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.
1049324	You have obtained the scroll of power!  Find your way out of the cave.<BR><BR>Hand the scroll to Uzeraan (drag and drop) once you arrive in his mansion.
1049323	Find Schmendrick's apprentice who is somewhere in the mining cave.  The apprentice has the scroll of power needed by Uzeraan.
1049322	<I>Schmendrick barely pays you any attention as you approach him.  His mind seems to be occupied with something else.  You explain to him that you came for the scroll of power and after a long while he begins to speak, but apparently still not giving you his full attention...</I><BR><BR>Hmmm.. peculiar indeed.  Very strange activity here indeed... I wonder...<BR><BR>Hmmm.  Oh yes! Scroll, you say?  I don't have it, sorry. My apprentice was carrying it, and he ran off to somewhere in this cave.  Find him and you will find the scroll.<BR><BR>Be sure to bring the scroll to Uzeraan once you have it. He's the only person aside from myself who can read the ancient markings on the scroll.  I need to figure out what's going on down here before I can leave.  Strange activity indeed...<BR><BR><I>Schmendrick goes back to his work and you seem to completely fade from his awareness...

1048107	If the list has not ever displayed, try holding the shift key and left-clicking on the pack horse.  Take your pack horse south to the mountains to receive further instructions.
1048106	The pack horse should whinny and walk towards you (unless it is not well fed), after you target yourself with the target cursor.
1048105	Click on the name on the health bar, delete its current name and type in a new name like 'Ed' or 'Trigger' (without spaces in the name).
1048104	To feed your pack horse, you would drag one apple or pear onto your pack horse.  A good practice is to feed your pack horse once an hour.
1048103	Visit Uzeraan after you have loaded 40 large piles of ore onto your pack horse.
1048102	You should have a bank check in your backpack (a yellow check).  Speak the word 'bank' to open your bank box, drag your bank check into the box, and double-click it to cash it in.
1048101	The Leader Lies Dead
1048100	A Time For Healing
1048099	You have just slain your first 'Shadow Wisp'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself if need be.
1048098	Now you can open the door (double click) to free the apprentice.
1048097	Use the key (double click) and target the door on the prison cage. This will unlock the door.
1048096	Open (double click) the red box and find the key inside. Take the key (drag and drop into your pack).
1048095	Cast the Unlock spell on the red box to open the lock.
1048094	Be sure to check his corpse (double click) for the red box which holds the key to the cage in which the apprentice is being held.
1048093	You have slain the leader of the pack.
1048092	Alternatively, if you know your way around spellbooks and such, you can cast the Heal or Greater Heal spells to recover lost hitpoints.
1048091	To heal yourself you may use bandages (double click bandages and target yourself) or drink a heal potion (free one of your hands and double click the potion).
1048090	Double click the status bar to see detailed information. Check your hitpoints and determine if you would like to heal yourself at this point or not. 
1048089	To check your health, single left-click + drag away from your avatar. This brings up your status bar. 
1048088	You have just slain your first 'Headless'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself, if need be.
1048087	Folk from around the world of Britannia can wear your signed armor and wield your signature weapons when you are a grandmaster blacksmith.
1048086	When you have reached 100 skill in blacksmithing, you will have the ability to mark your crafted items with your name.
1048085	Now that you have helped the blacksmiths of Minoc, you have proved your worthiness of mastering blacksmithing.
1048084	Mastering blacksmithing
1048083	Visit Uzeraan once you have completed the orders for the armourers of Minoc.
1048082	The large order deed, when it is filled with all of the small deeds, would then be dropped onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.  They will make sure your goods go to those in need.
1048081	Combine the items requested in the order with the small deed.  Once the deed is completed, you can use the large order deed to combine with a smaller deed.
1048080	One of the deeds is the large order, which must be combined to completed order deeds.  The three smaller deeds are for chainmail.
1048079	Uzeraan says: Ah, I see that you are well on your way to mastering blacksmithing.  I have four order deeds that the armourers would like you to fulfill in Minoc.
1048078	Now that you are an accomplished blacksmith, Uzeraan has another set of orders the armourers of Minoc would like you to fulfill.  Once completed, give them to an armourer or blacksmith in the city of Minoc.
1048077	You do not need to hurry out and train.  The world is waiting to be explored and some adventurers may need your skills.  Come visit me when you have trained to 70 skill (or higher).
1048076	Now that you have accomplished so much, you should train your blacksmithing skill so you may perform a more difficult task.  It may take some time to train to 70 skill.  I have a task to ask of you when you have finished training.
1048075	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  You have mastered the basics of mining and blacksmithing.  I am giving you 500 gold for your ore.  You may keep your pack horse.
1048074	Uzeraan encourages you to practice to 70 skill in blacksmithing.  You do not have to train immediately.  When you have reached 70 skill, visit Uzeraan.
1048073	You can double-click on your pack horse to open its backpack.  While open, you can load your pack horse by dropping items into its backpack.
1048072	Now that you know how to handle your pack horse, use your new pack horse to haul 40 large piles of ore from the mountains.  You will need to tinker a couple more shovels to be able to mine the ore.
1048071	Mine 40 piles of ore from the mountains and use your pack horse to haul the piles of ore.  Visit Uzeraan at his mansion once you have the 40 piles of ore.
1048070	To get your pet to stay, you would tell it to stay by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'stay' from the command list.
1048069	Try walking away from your pack horse and tell it to follow you by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'follow'.
1048068	All pets you own can be renamed.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the pack horse and drag its health bar.
1048067	Once you have renamed your pack horse, you can have your pet obey commands.  The most common commands are 'follow me' and 'stay'.  However, your pet must be in range to hear you.
1048066	Pack horses are loyal to their masters unless they are not fed.  Apples or pears are foods that the pack horses appreciate and will keep them loyal.
1048065	Pack horses are used to carry large quantities of items that you normally could not fit in your backpack.  Miners use them for carrying large quantities of ore, ingots, and some tools.
1048064	Uzeraan explains how to use a pack horse.  Take your pack horse to mountains south of Uzeraan's castle.
1048063	After you have finished depositing items in your bank, visit Uzeraan for a pack horse.
1048062	The safest place for any of your goods is your bank box.  No one can access your bank box except for you.
1048061	Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place into a bank box anywhere can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.
1048060	Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.
1048059	Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.
1048058	How to open your bank account by saying the word 'bank' and depositing items.  Once finished, visit Uzeraan and he will give you a pack horse.
1048057	As you approach the bank, the names of bankers and their titles of 'banker' or 'minter' will appear.  This means you have located the building where you can access your bank account.
1048056	Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithing skill a couple points.  Now, I would like to let you take some time to put your goods in the bank. The bank is right next to the mansion to the southeast.
1048055	Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.
1048054	Uzeraan explains the bank is on the north side of town.  Take your bank check to a banker and drop it on the banker to cash it in.
1048053	You can't stable that!
1048052	Double click the grey order deeds to open them.  Once open, the deed lists which items and what quantity the armourer needs.  Once you forge an item, combine the item with the deed by choosing ‘Combine Item’ and targeting the item.
1048051	Remember that there are 8 different reagents: Spider's Silk, Bloodmoss, Mandrake, Ginseng, Nightshade, Garlic, Black Pearl and Sulfurous Ash.
1048050	Please go and gather at least 35 of each reagent before returning.
1048049	I don't feel comfortable sending you into this battle with the amount of reagents you currently have on your person.

500318	This flask is empty.

500316	You create a mysterious potion

500289	Where is a bottle or keg for your potion?
500288	Dead people can't make potions.
500287	You fail to create a useful potion.
500286	You were unable to complete your work before you died.
500285	You are unsure what is in the keg, and decide not to add your mixture to it.
500284	You are wise enough not to add a different type of potion to that keg.
500283	That container is too full to hold your potion.
500282	You create the potion and pour it into the keg.
500281	...but there is no room in your backpack.

1040028	You fail to make the bola and ruin the leather in the process.
1040027	You do not have enough leather to make this.
1040026	You do not have enough bola balls to make this.
1040025	You make the bola and place it in your pack.
1040024	You are still too dazed from being knocked off your mount to ride!
1040023	You have been knocked off of your mount!
1040022	You fail to knock the rider from their mount.
1040021	That is already being used.
1040020	You must wait a few moments before you can throw another bola
1040019	The bola must be in your pack to use it.
1040018	You have no reason to throw a bola at that
1040017	You can't throw this at yourself
1040016	You cannot use this while riding a mount
1040015	Your hands must be free to use this

1040010	You combine the berry and the flour into the tribal paint worn by the savages.
1040009	With a sack of flour a cook could make this into the body paint used by the savages.

3010154	Plant Seeds
3010153	In order to plant a seed, you first need a special bowl.  Plant bowls can be purchased from a provisioner for a small price.<BR><BR>Once you have an empty plant bowl, you'll need to fill it with dirt before you can plant a seed in it.<BR><BR>To fill a plant bowl with dirt, double-click the bowl to use it, and then target a source of nice soft brown dirt.  If you've targeted an appropriate patch of dirt, you'll now have a bowl full of dirt.  Add in enough water to soften the dirt, and you'll have a perfect spot for planting a <a href="?50">seed</a>!
3010152	Plant Bowl
3010151	Using special seeds harvested from slain monsters, you may grow uniquely colored plants to use as house decorations or to produce hybrid seeds and resources. <BR><BR> As your plant grows from a seed to a full-grown plant, it will need watering and alchemical care in order to protect if from insect infestations and harmful fungi.<BR><BR>Through the process of cross-pollination, you may even be the first person to grow a unique new hybrid plant type!

3010145	Public Moongates can be used to travel to various destinations throughout the land.  To use a moongate, simply step into it and choose your destination when prompted.  Once you select a destination, you will be instantly teleported there.
3010144	The chance to learn a skill is increased during the first hour of play each day for each character on your account. Note this only affects the chance to increase a skill, not the chance to succeed in using it.<br><br>You will experience a power hour during your first hour of play for each character within a 24 hour period, which means that technically, the power hour will be refreshed 23 hours after the previous power hour has ended, per character. If any character does not log in for over 24 hours, their power hour will begin as soon as they log in, and last for one full hour. Every character on your account has their own burst hour.<br><br>As an example, a player who logs in at 8:00 PM local time will experience a power hour that will last until 9:00 PM. They will not be able to experience another power hour during that 24 hour period, so they will not receive another power hour until at least 8:00 PM the following day. If they do not log in again until 10:00 PM, they will experience their full power hour, beginning at 10:00 PM and lasting until 11:00 PM. The following day, they will not be able to experience a power hour until at least 10:00 PM local time.<br><br>The times stated above are YOUR time - they are not based on any form of server time. Server time zones have nothing to do with your power hour times.<br><br>Your burst time does not carry over to another day. If you don't use your entire burst hour in any 24 hour period, you forfeit any unused time.<br><br>To benefit most from your power hour, you need to use it all at once. If you log in at 10am, play for half an hour, and log out, power hour for that character will expire at 11am. It is not saved for later.<br><br>The burst system does not affect non-difficulty skills that are below base 70.0, like Anatomy, Evaluating Intelligence, and Meditation. Difficulty skills are those like Tailoring, Carpentry, and Magery, where there are always more difficult levels to attain.
3010143	Karma is a measure of both the good and evil deeds you have done, and is raised and lowered by a large and diverse number of activities.  Raising your Karma might be accomplished by killing evil NPCs, giving gold to good NPCs, or casting beneficial spells on other players.  Your Karma could be lowered by using the Snooping, Stealing, Begging, or Poisoning skill, summoning Daemons, or killing good NPCs.<br><br>Your Karma affects your title.  If your Karma ever drops to the lowest level, NPC shopkeepers will refuse to do business with you.  Player-run Vendors will continue to do business with you, however.
3010142	Fame represents how well-known you are by deeds such as completing both quests and bulk order deeds, and killing monsters worth more Fame than your current level.  If you reach a high level of Fame, your professional title becomes viewable by anyone who looks at your Paperdoll.<br><br>Each time your character dies, they lose 10% of their Fame.
3010141	Skill Locks grant you control over your skill advancement, and are manipulated in the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>.  To open the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>, press the Skills button on your Paperdoll.  A small icon is located next to each skill.  An arrow pointing up signifies the skill can only advance.  A lock signifies the skill cannot advance or degrade.  An arrow pointing down signifies the skill cannot advance, and will eventually degrade if another skill is increased while you are at your skill total maximum.  This is very important, because if no skills are pointed down once at your skill total maximum, you cannot gain in any skill.
3010140	Practice dummies provide a safe way to learn the basics of combat and stealing - up to 25.0 points in the respective skill.  To use a practice dummy, just move in close and double-click it.  For combat practice dummies, you'll have to wield the weapon in which you wish to train before double-clicking.
3010139	Each time you use a skill, there is a chance it will increase.  Many skills grant you a much better chance to increase if the attempt is difficult relative to its current value; these are referred to as Difficulty Based skills.  For example, around 75.0 Swordsmanship, you have a fairly good chance to gain skill by swinging your sword at an earth elemental, and almost no chance when taking on a cow or rabbit.<br><br>You can quickly get a rudimentary amount of skill from an NPC trainer.  To train, left-click an <a href="?31">NPC</a> to view their interactive menu, and select the skill you wish to train.  The NPC will tell you how much it costs to advance in the skill.   Then, just drag and drop the proper amount of gold onto them.  Note that not all NPCs can train.<br><br>If ever you find yourself in a rut and not gaining skill, first ensure you are really able to gain (see <a href="?42">Skill Locks</a>).  If everything looks good, simply try changing things up a bit - explore or try a different target.  It might just get you out of that rut, or at least make it an interesting time trying.
3010138	Your skills define your character.  They are the activities in which your character most often participates and, with enough practice, excels.  Skills have a maximum trained value of 100.0, although they can go beyond that limit with rare magical items.  Additionally, you cannot exceed a total of 700 total skill points in all skills combined.
3010137	Your bankbox is highly magical in that it is completely secure, and contains the same contents regardless of where you open it.  Your bankbox can contain no more than 125 items, but has no weight restrictions.  Stacks of items count as a single item towards the item limit.<br><br>To open your bankbox: locate a banker or minter inside a bank, left-click them to view their interactive menu and select Open Bankbox.  You can also stand next to a bank and say the word, 'Bank.'
3010136	Reagents are the material components used to cast a spell.  They are also used by those skilled in Alchemy to create magical potions, and are thus highly sought after in the lands of Britannia.<br><br>Reagents are purchased from <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a> in the magical and alchemical trades, and it is not uncommon to find a <a href="?34">Vendor</a> stocked with reagents as well.  They can even be picked up off the ground.  These ground-dwelling reagents tend to thrive in areas to which they are indigenous; you might find Spider Silk in a graveyard or Sulfurous Ash near a volcano.
3010135	Spellbooks contain a collection of permanently inscribed spells for casting.  You may open a spellbook by double-clicking it and then flip through the pages to see which spells it contains.<br><br>If you flip to the page containing a spell, you will find a listing of the reagents required and a small representative icon.  Double-clicking the icon attempts to cast the spell.  If you drag the icon from the spellbook and drop it in the gameplay window, it behaves just as if it were in the spellbook when double-clicked, creating a handy shortcut for casting the spell.<br><br>To add a spell to your spellbook: obtain a scroll with the desired spell, and then drag and drop the scroll onto your spellbook.
3010134	Magic is common in the lands of Ultima Online, used by all and mastered by some.  When you try to cast a spell, your Magery skill and the spell circle determine your chance for success.  If successful, your Mana is lowered by an amount required by the spell.  High circle spells are more difficult to cast, and require a fair amount of Mana and skill in Magery before they may even be attempted.  Additionally, you must possess either a spellbook or scroll containing the spell you wish to cast.<br><br>If you use a spellbook, you must also have in your backpack the reagents required to cast the spell. See <a href="?36">Spellbooks</a> for more information.<br><br>If you use a scroll, reagents are not required, and the level of the spell is 2 circles lower for purposes of minimum Magery required and success rate.  Once successfully cast, the scroll is consumed.  Double-click a scroll to cast from it.<br><br>While casting, your hands must be free.  There is one exception, in that you may hold a spellbook in your hands if desired.
3010133	A vendor is a type of player-run shopkeeper who sells only goods placed on them by their owner, at prices set by their owner.  Vendors can only be placed in their owner's house, and they do not wander.  You can browse their inventory by double-clicking them and rummaging through their backpack just as you would your own.  Single left-clicking items shows you the description of the item, as well as the price.  If you wish to purchase something, say 'vendor buy' and target the item.  You are then asked to confirm your purchase.  Remember, the money is taken directly from your bank, so you don't need to travel with large sums of gold if you go on a shopping spree.
3010132	Shopkeepers buy and sell goods.  They only buy that which they sell, and their stores automatically restock several times each hour, increasing to even larger amounts when completely bought out.  To interact with a shopkeeper, left-click them to display their interactive menu, and select either Buy or Sell.  If they are near enough to their shop, an appropriate menu pops up and business commences!
3010131	Monsters are the ever-present inhabitants of Britannia.  Most of them are terribly aggressive, and attack on sight.  A much smaller group tries to live in peace, signified by the blue coloring of their name.  Should you decide to bring your wrath upon these peace-loving denizens, your karma will eventually be lowered until you are recognized and attacked without provocation by even them.  You can gain good standing again by slaying exclusively those monsters aggressive to everyone.
3010130	Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are living creatures controlled by the game engine.  They may react to your actions depending on the who, where, when and how of the situation.  The three main types of NPCs are: <a href="?32">Monsters</a>, <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a>, and <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.
3010129	When an enemy is slain, not just anyone can loot treasure from the corpse.  The right to loot is determined by the amount of damage done, with substantial weight added for those who struck the initial and killing blow.  In non-consensual PVP areas, you are allowed to loot corpses without proper rights, but doing so will flag you as a criminal and is extremely likely to paint a target on your chest.
3010128	When you take damage from weapon or <a href="?35">Magic</a>, your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are lowered.  You can raise them through being healed, unless they go below zero, in which case you will die.  You are considered to be in full health when your Hit Points are at their maximum, and you should try to maintain this state whenever possible.<br><br>You can heal with bandages by double-clicking a bandage (or stack of bandages) and targeting yourself.  This method is best suited for warriors, as it uses the Healing and Anatomy skills to determine your success.  Applying a bandage takes several seconds, and each time you take damage during that time reduces your effectiveness, so take care to run away from combat until the bandaging is complete.<br><br>Those skilled in Magery will most likely find the healing spells In Mani and In Vas Mani much more to their liking.<br><br>Those inclined in the way of the Paladin, may also use their <a href="?100">Close Wounds</a> ability to heal themselves.<br><br>Should you find yourself wounded and completely without skill in the healing arts, another player can heal you at least as well as, and often better than, they could heal themselves...if asked politely. If you are <a href="?16">Young</a>, a wandering <a href="?31">NPC</a> healer will cast spells to heal you when you approach.
3010127	To attack an enemy, you must first enter War Mode by clicking the War/Peace button on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> (it will read 'Peace', since you are currently in Peace mode).  Once clicked, the button turns red, the text changes to War, and your character enters a fighting stance.  Double-clicking an enemy while in War Mode initiates an attack and places you in combat with them.<br><br>To leave War Mode, click the War button or press Tab.  Leaving War Mode ceases your attack.  Be careful, for it is unlikely your opponent will stop attacking you.<br><br>When you are first attacked, even while not in War Mode, you will automatically defend yourself.
3010125	Your Stamina determines how fast you can swing a weapon.  The more Stamina you have, the faster you'll swing.  Your maximum Stamina is the same as your <a href="?25">Dexterity</a> statistic.  Several factors reduce your Stamina, including: taking damage, running, and special wrestling moves.<br><br>When you are in a non-consensual PVP area, pushing through players and monsters reduces your Stamina by 10, and you cannot push through unless you are at maximum Stamina.
3010124	Dexterity is your hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes.<br><br><a href="?26">Stamina</a> is determined by your Dexterity.
3010123	Your Mana is the energy that allows you to cast <a href="?35">Magic</a>.  After expending Mana to cast a spell, it slowly recovers at a rate described in the Meditation skill section.  Your maximum Mana is the same as your <a href="?23">Intelligence</a> statistic.
3010122	Intelligence is the mental capacity of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is determined by your Intelligence.<br><br>Your Intelligence affects the rate at which your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is regained.
3010121	Hit Points are a numerical measure of your ability to survive damage.  The more Hit Points you have, the tougher you are.  If your Hit Points ever go below zero, you will die.<br><br>Your Hit Points are calculated by: (Strength / 2) + 50.  Magical bonuses to your Strength add directly to your Hit Points at a ratio of 1 to 1.
3010120	Strength is the physical essence of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are determined by your Strength.<br><br>Your maximum carry capacity in stones is calculated by: (Strength * 7) / 2) + 40.<br><br>You receive a melee percentage damage bonus of: Strength / 5.
3010119	Your stats are the physical and mental attributes of your character, each of which affects other sub-characteristics of your character.  Stats increase automatically based on the skills you use, up to a maximum of 100 in any single stat, and no more than 225 in total stat points.  If you have reached the 225 stat maximum, and one of your stats increases, one of the other two stats is randomly lowered to make room.
3010118	You cannot poison others with poisoned weapons.<br><br>You cannot join a faction.
3010117	Aggressive monsters do not automatically attack you.<br><br>Vendors will buy back most items that you purchased for their full value.<br><br>You are offered special quests if you selected one of the templates during character creation.<br><br>Other players cannot attack or steal from you.<br><br>Poisoned weapons do not poison you.<br><br>You can use level zero treasure maps.<br><br>Other players cannot loot the corpses of monsters you have slain.<br><br>When you die, you are teleported to the nearest healer, and retain all your possessions.
3010116	For your character to receive <a href="?16">Young Status</a> and benefits thereof, your account must have less than forty hours of combined playtime.  Additionally, a character automatically loses their <a href="?16">Young Status</a> if their skill point total exceeds 450 points.
3010115	Players who are new to Ultima Online have an opportunity to play the game as a young character for a length of time.  Young characters are afforded certain benefits that allow them to learn the game more easily, listed in the <a href="?18">Young Player Benefits</a> section.
3010114	To speak to other players or <a href="?31">NPCs</a>, type what you wish to say (your text will appear at the bottom of the screen as you type) and press Enter.  The text will be displayed above your head and can be seen by everyone on screen.
3010113	Interactive Menus are dynamic menus available on certain objects in the world, such as <a href="?31">NPCs</a>, that list the possible interactions you can have with that object.  To view the Interactive Menu for an object, left-click the object.  If you have altered the default options, you may have to use shift left-click.  When a menu selection is gray, it is not currently available, but selecting it will tell you the reason it is disabled.
3010112	The Radar Map displays an expanded view of the surrounding terrain and architecture.  To display the Radar Map, click the Map button on the toolbar, or press Alt-R.  The Radar Map has two sizes, toggled by double-clicking the Radar Map itself, or pressing Alt-R again.
3010111	Your character will use many different items in their travels, most of which you'll carry in your backpack.  To open your backpack, double-click the backpack picture on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a>, click the Inventory button on the toolbar, or press Alt-I.<br><br>You can move things into your backpack by left-clicking the item, dragging it over your backpack and releasing it.  Alternatively, you can drag and drop objects directly onto your character in the game and they will be automatically placed in your backpack.  Your backpack has a hard limit on the number of items it can hold, but weight is limited by your character's <a href="?21">Strength</a> statistic.
3010110	To wear a piece of armor or arm yourself with a weapon, left-click and drag the weapon or armor onto your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> character and release it.  Be warned that if you are already wearing or wielding a similar piece of equipment, you must remove that piece before you can equip the new armor, weapon or clothing.<br><br>To remove a piece of armor or disarm a weapon, left-click and drag it from your Paperdoll character into your backpack, bank box, or onto the ground.  Remember that other players can take any items you drop onto the ground!
3010109	This button displays your character's status bar.  The status bar shows several vital statistics for your character in either numerical or abbreviated format.
3010108	This button toggles whether or not you are in War Mode.  In War Mode, the button is colored red and enables you to attack your opponents by double-clicking them.
3010107	This button displays the chat window.  The Ultima Online chat system enables you to talk to other players on your shard who are not near you in-game.
3010106	The Skills button shows a list of skills and your level of expertise in each.  Many of your skill levels are modified by your stats; to see your base skill level, click the Show Real option.

3010105	The Journal button displays a history of everything you have said and heard in-game recently.

3010197	If you would like to empty your plant bowl of the plant or seed and start over again, you may use the Empty Bowl button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>If the plant in the bowl is in the <a href="?50">seed</a> or sapling stage, emptying the bowl will result in a bowl and the seed placed in your backpack.<BR><BR>If the bowl only had dirt in it, or the plant had grown beyond the sapling phase, emptying the bowl will destroy the plant, returning only the plant bowl to your backpack.
3010196	Emptying the Bowl
3010195	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, a Decorative Mode symbol will appear in the Resources Menu.  This symbol is displayed as a leafy plant with a red / symbol through it.<BR><BR>Pressing this button (and clicking Yes to apply) will set the plant to Decorative Mode.<BR><BR>A plant set to Decorative Mode will not produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> or <a href="?69">resources</a>, and cannot be used for <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a>.  A Decorative Plant does not need upkeep, however, and is always in a <a href="?52">healthy</a> state.<BR><BR>Decorative Mode should be activated if you simply want your plant to be used as a house decoration, and therefore do not want to have to water it or keep it healthy.<BR><BR>A Decorative Plant will have the tag [decorative] displayed above it when single-clicked.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTE : Once a plant is set to Decorative Mode, it cannot be set back to its normal state.  A Decorative Plant will never produce seeds or resources again.
3010194	Decorative Mode
3010193	Certain plant type and color combinations result in a plant that can produce unique resources.<BR><BR>A plant will begin producing resources at the same time it produces <a href="?50">seeds</a>, when it reaches its maximum growth level.<BR><BR>One resource is produced per day, up to a maximum of eight resources.  A plant will only produce resources if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather resources from a plant by using the Gather Resources button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available resources from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of resources available is displayed next to the Resource # indicator (petal image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.<BR><BR>Resources produced by unique plant combinations have special properties dependant on the resource type and color.
3010191	When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, it will no longer grow in size, but will instead produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> any time a <a href="?51">growth check</a> is performed.<BR><BR>The type of seed that a plant produces is determined by whether it pollinated itself, or if pollen from another plant was applied to it during the <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a> process.<BR><BR>A plant will produce one seed per day, up to a maximum of eight seeds.  A plant will only produce a seed if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather seeds from a plant by using the Gather Seeds button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available seeds from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of seeds available is displayed next to the Seed # indicator (seed image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.
3010190	Seed Production
3010189	The Pollination State indicator displays the current pollination state of a plant.<BR><BR>A yellow - symbol indicates that the plant has not yet produced any pollen, as it has not reached full-grown level.<BR><BR>A red ! symbol indicates that the plant has entered its pollen producing state, and can have pollen gathered from it, or be <a href="?66">cross-pollinated</a> to.<BR><BR>A green + symbol indicates that the plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural self-pollination, or by the pollen of another plant).  While you can still gather pollen from a plant in this state, the plant can no longer be the target of cross-pollination.
3010188	Pollination State
3010187	When a plant first reaches its full-grown state, it will sprout its full foliage, no longer contained within the plant bowl.  At this stage of the plant's growth, it will begin to produce pollen.  You can view your plant's current <a href="?67">Pollination State</a> in the Plant Resources Menu.  The plant will eventually self-pollinate if left unattended, and the plant will begin to produce <a href="?50">seeds</a>.  Seeds produced by a self-pollinated plant will grow up into an exact duplicate of the "parent" plant.<BR><BR>Another method of pollination is called "cross-pollination".  Once a plant reaches the pollen-producing stage, its pollen may be gathered by the owner by using the Cross-Pollination button.  Gathered pollen may be used on another full-grown plant.  When you pollinate one plant with pollen from another plant, the targeted plant will produce seeds that will grow into a hybrid of the two plants.  The color and type of each "parent" plant are combined to produce a new type of seed that will grow from the targeted plant.<BR><BR>While you may continue to gather pollen from a plant throughout its entire life cycle, once a plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural pollination, or through manual cross-pollination from another plant), no further combinations may be performed.  The seed type that the plant will produce is determined the first time the plant is pollinized, and cannot be changed afterwards.<BR><BR>In very rare circumstances, cross-pollination may result in a "mutation".  If mutation occurs, the targeted plant will not produce seeds that are a combination of the two "parent" plants, but will instead produce "mutated" seeds that grow into mutant plant varieties.
3010186	Cross-Pollination
3010185	You may apply strength potions to a plant in order to help it resist insect infestations and fungus growth.  Each strength potion applied will lower the chance of infestation by harmful maladies.  Strength potions are soaked up by a plant during its normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new strength potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.
3010184	Strength Potions (Plants)
3010183	You may apply heal potions to a plant in order to cure it of poison or disease.  Heal potions are applied during a plant's normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new heal potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.<BR><BR>If heal potions are applied to a plant that is not poisoned or diseased, and the plant has no other maladies currently affecting it, then the heal potions will be used to help increase the plant's current hit points (in addition to the natural healing a plant performs if it is not currently infected by any maladies).
3010182	Heal Potions (Plants)
3010181	You may apply various potions to a plant in order to cure it of various maladies, help it to heal back up to maximum health, or strengthen it against infestations.  Potions are applied through the Water button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>The following potions may be used on plants :<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?59">Cure Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?57">Poison Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?65">Strength Potions</a>
3010180	Potions (Plants)
3010179	The Water Level meter (water pitcher image) shows the amount of <a href="?61">water</a> in your plant bowl.  Unlike other state meters, the Water Level meter displays both negative (under-watered) and positive (over-watered) levels.<BR><BR>A yellow - sign indicates the plant is slightly under-watered.  A red - sign indicates a severely under-watered plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign indicates the plant has been slightly over-watered.  A red + sign indicates the plant has been severely over-watered.
3010178	Water Level
3010177	In order to keep your plant healthy, you must water it regularly.  An under-watered plant will wither and die if left unattended.  However, it is important to remember that over-watering your plant is also unhealthy.  Over-watered plants become waterlogged and lose <a href="?52">health</a>, in addition to becoming perfect breeding grounds for <a href="?53">insects</a> and <a href="?55">fungi</a>.<BR><BR>Each time a plant performs its <a href="?51">growth check</a> (approximately once a day), the plant will soak up one dose of water, so you'll need to keep a constant eye on your plant to make sure it has not dried out.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?62">Water Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010176	Watering
3010175	The Disease Level meter (purple goo image) shows the strength of the <a href="?59">disease</a> affecting your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly infected.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely infected.
3010174	Disease Level
3010173	You may apply cure potions to a plant in order to cure it of harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>. If you apply too many cure potions, however, or apply cure potions when the plant is not infected by fungi, you will infect your plant with a deadly disease which will cause it to wither and die.<BR><BR>When you apply cure potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as fungi only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any harmful fungi will be cured by your cure potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally infect your plant with a disease by over-curing it, you can use <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the disease.<BR><BR>You may view your plant's current <a href="?60">Disease Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010172	Curing (Plants)
3010171	The Poison Level meter (skull image) shows the amount of <a href="?57">poison</a> that your plant has soaked up.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant is slightly poisoned.  A red + sign indicates that the plant is severely poisoned.
3010170	Poison Level
3010169	You may apply poison potions to your plant to kill insects infesting it.  If you apply too many poison potions, however, or apply poison potions when there are no insects on the plant, then your plant will soak up the poison and become sick.<BR><BR>When you apply poison potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as <a href="?53">insects</a> only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any insects will be killed off by your poison potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally poison your plant, you can cure the plant of poison by using <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the poison.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?58">Poison Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010168	Poison (Plants)
3010167	The Fungus Level meter (mushroom image) shows the amount of <a href="?55">fungi</a> that are currently sapping health from your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small fungus infection.  A red + sign indicates a severe fungus infection.
3010166	Fungus Level
3010165	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infected with harmful fungi.  Fungi sap the plant of its health, which will cause it to wither and die.  It is important to remember that fungi love moist areas, so over-watering your plant increases the chance that it will become infected by harmful fungi.<BR><BR>You may cure your plant of fungus by using <a href="?59">cure potions</a>.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?56">Fungus Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010164	Fungus
3010163	The Infestation Level meter (grey bug image) shows the relative amount of <a href="?53">insects</a> that are currently attacking your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small infestation.  A red + sign indicates a severe infestation.
3010162	Infestation Level
3010161	As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infested by insects.  These insects will slowly eat at a plant, causing it to lose <a href="?52">health</a> and eventually die.  Different plants have different chances of being infested.  Flowery plants, over-watered plants, and bright plants all have a greater chance of attracting hungry insects, so they’ll need even more attention from their owner.<BR><BR>You can use <a href="?57">poison potions</a> on your plant in order to kill off the insects that have infested it.  Be sure that you do not use too much poison, however, or your plant will soak up the poison, which can cause it to wither and die!<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?54">Infestation Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.
3010160	Infestation
3010158	Plant Health
3010157	Plants take time to grow through their various stages.  A plant has nine main stages of growth, from <a href="?50">seed</a>, to sapling, to fully grown plant.  Plants will not grow in containers, unless the container is in a player's backpack.  If a plant is <a href="?52">healthy</a> and well-tended, it will grow one "stage" of its life-cycle in about a day's time.  If a plant is not healthy because it has not been well taken care of, then it will not grow.  You must keep your plant in a healthy state by curing it of any maladies that might be affecting it, and then letting it heal naturally or help it along through <a href="?63">alchemical means</a>.
3010156	Plant Growth
3010155	Plant seeds come in many different colors.  When planted in a <a href="?49">bowl of dirt</a> and carefully tended to over time, plant seeds will grow into full-grown plants.  These plants can be used for <a href="?70">decorative purposes</a> only, or as a source of new <a href="?66">hybrid</a> plant seeds and specially grown <a href="?69">resources</a>.<BR><BR>While you can tell what color of plant the seed will grow into by the color of the seed itself, the type of plant that results from a particular seed remains a mystery until the plant is fully-grown!<BR><BR>The first step in growing a seed into a plant is planting it in a bowl of soft dirt.  In order to plant a seed, simply double-click the seed to use it, and then target a bowl of soft dirt.  Freshly dug dirt isn't soft enough for a seed to be planted in, so you'll need to pour <a href="?61">water</a> into your bowl of dirt before attempting to place a seed in it.

1076855	Casca of Heartwood as the Plaintiff, representing the government of Britannia.
1076854	Can you truly say that Ricardo has done nothing good for the Kingdom?
1076853	Can you truly say all that Ricardo has wrought is ill?
1076852	By what authority do you judge this crime High Treason?
1076851	By the authority vested in the Royal Council, ruling pro-tempore, and by the Treason Act.
1076850	But we cannot show mercy.
1076849	But wait, I’m not… I’m f…
1076848	But they were too fast. And then the big ‘uns, the ones with the blood-stained bardiches…
1076847	But one thing I can tell you is the Truth.
1076846	But I cannot.
1076845	Britannia versus Ricardo.
1076844	Britannia lays claim to all of the Lost Lands.
1076843	Both of my representatives have proven useless to me. Both were provided by the government, which also tries me.
1076842	Because they’re afraid you’ll discover the truth. And the truth is this:
1076841	Beauregard of Trinsic, for the Defense.
1076840	Be seated.
1076839	Be seated, please.
1076838	Be patient. Continue Mr. Casca.
1076837	Bailiff, take this man away.
1076836	Bailiff! Escort this man from the building!
1076835	Aye. Aye… Saw the innkeeper’s girl run into the old shipwright’s. She’d been in the weaponsmith’s - had something in her hand.
1076834	Aye, that’s them.
1076833	Aye, ‘tis a beautiful little town, sitting on the shore surrounded by jungle.
1076832	At any time.
1076831	Ask thineselves, “Is it reasonable that a man should be put to death for committing a crime he couldst not know would harm another?"
1076830	Ask thineselves,  “Is it possible that an entire war could begin with the actions of just one man?”
1076829	As is the Court. Didst thou have any further witnesses?
1076828	Art thou prepared to open?
1076827	Are you familiar with the Scion’s Zenith?
1076826	And you just sat there?
1076825	And yes, my friends, this was well beyond the Kingdom’s borders.
1076823	And we appreciate it. My lord, has the Royal Council considered the charges of treason against Ricardo?
1076822	And how have you defined this instance of High Treason?
1076821	And finally, ask thyself,  “If it were I in Ricardo’s place, how wouldst I wish to be treated?”
1076820	And because that many other like Cases of Treason may happen in Time to come, which a Man cannot think nor declare at this present Time;
1076819	An army that would soon overwhelm Papua’s pitiful defenses, and march on towards our heartland.
1076818	Always a pleasure.
1076817	All those having anything to do before the Honorable Verina, Justice of the Court of Truth, draw near and attend.
1076816	All this was shattered one horrible morning... In a single instant everything she'd held dear was ripped away from her.
1076815	All rise! Hear ye, hear ye!
1076814	All rise!
1076813	All may be seated.
1076812	Aha! Did you hear that everyone!?
1076811	Ah.
1076810	Ah, well, then. Carry on.
1076809	Ah, hiccups, Your Honor, just a tad nervous.
1076808	Ah, and could you tell me a little about Papua? Before the invasion, I mean.
1076807	Ah, *hic*, ah, yes Your Honor, I am present.
1076806	A trial by fire burns the beast!
1076805	A thousand things contributed to this war - the Scion’s Zenith was just one of them.
1076804	A man who's arrogance, who's unmitigated gall, who's foolhardy quest for glory and riches so infuriated the Ophidians that they poured war down upon us.
1076803	A man who fled to safety, never warning those left behind of the horrors following after him.
1076802	A game played by politicians and liars (as though the two could be separate!)
1076801	A friend of the defendant?
1076800	A fate, I believe, that will be bound by Justice. Thank you.
1076799	‘Cause the court ordered me.
1076798	*hic*
1076797	The former to be no less than five-score peoples, the latter to be no less than the value of the smallest town in the realm.

1075784	*smiles* I understandeth thy feelings, friend. Ye shall remain anonymous then, to all those who shall benefit from thine efforts.<BR><br>Yet, through all these trials, perhaps thou hast come a little closer to understanding the true nature of Humility.<br>Thine efforts might seem small compared to the great world in which we live, but as more of our people work together, stronger shall our people be.<BR><BR><br>I wish for ye to keep the cloak I gave thee earlier. Thou canst do with it what thou will, but I hope that it shall serve as a reminder of the days ye spent engaged in our simple cause.<br>And although I have nothing more for thee, I wouldest exhort ye to continue upon this path, always seeking opportunities to humble thyself to the demands of the world.<br>There is a small island to the south upon which lies the Shrine of Humility. Seek solace there, and perhaps the answers to thine questions will become clear.
1075783	*smiles* Surely thy deeds will be recognized by those who see thee wearing this shield! It shall serve as a reminder of the exalted path that thou hast journeyed upon, and I wish to thank thee on behalf of all whom thine efforts shall benefit. Ah, let us not forget that old cloak I gavest thee - I shall take it back now and give thee thine reward.
1075782	Noble friend, thou hast performed tremendously! On behalf of the Rise of Britannia I wish to reward thee with this golden shield, a symbol of accomplishment and pride for the many things that thou hast done for our people.<BR><BR><br>Dost thou accept?

1075773	Aha! Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for. What think ye of Sean? Of all those I have met, he is the least concerned with others' opinions of him. He excels at his craft, yet always believes he has something left to learn. *looks at the iron chain necklace* And it shows, does it not?
1075772	Wonderul!  A ~1_desire~!  Surely thou hast gone through much trouble to bring this for me. Please take this iron chain that I made for Gareth. ‘Tis something we once talked of for some time, and he had suggested a new method of metalworking that I have only just accomplished.
1075771	I do have a humble desire or two, though. I seem to have trouble finding a ~1_desire~.
1075770	Greetings to thee, friend! Art thou on some sort of quest? Ye have that look about ye, and that cloak looks somewhat familiar. Ah, no matter. A break from my blacksmithing work is always welcome! I canst only talk for a little while though, there are a few things I promised to have done for the township today. After all, a community is much like a long chain, and we can only be as stronger as our weakest link!
1075769	That grey cloak is very nice.
1075767	This ~1_gift~ was sent to me by mistake, I wouldest like to trade it for what I need.
1075766	I have my needs, however.  A ~1_desire~ would certainly help me.
1075765	I am the sort of person who wandereth the countryside for weeks, my friend. All that time I spend healing good people who art in need of my services. All of this done without any reward, save the knowledge that I leadeth a life of virtue.
1075764	Thou looketh like a fellow healer in that cloak.
1075763	Thou broughtest me a ~1_desire~! That will do nicely. Here, take this ~2_gift~ as thanks.
1075762	I received this ~1_gift~ as a gift. I hath no need for it, but wert ye to bring me something interesting, I would trade it, perhaps.
1075761	Speaking of useful, if ye findeth me a nice ~1_desire~, I wilt be grateful.
1075760	Greetings, friend. Didst thou know I work all day, preparing and storing all sorts of meat? My cleaver is not dainty or at all particular, but if ye bringeth something to me then I will render it useful for food. Every creature can be thought of as useful in life... or in death. Death comes to us all, my friend. I hath learned that, for certain, in this humble profession.
1075759	Art thou hiding under that cloak?
1075758	Thanks to thee! This ~1_desire~ is just right. Here, this ~2_gift~ is for thee.
1075757	This ~1_gift~ was given to me and I cannot use it. I wilt happily trade it for the right item.
1075756	All that I wilt ask for, is a ~1_desire~.
1075755	I feedeth any who come here with the means to pay.  Be they noblemen or commoners, peaceful or aggressive, artist or barbarian, tis not my place to judge. I believeth there is value in everyone, and thus serve all.
1075754	You, in the grey cloak, art thou hungry?
1075753	Ah, ‘tis a perfect ~1_desire~. Please take this ~2_gift~ in trade.
1075752	I useth this ~1_gift~ not at all. If ye bringeth me the right item, I would make a trade.
1075751	All that I needest is a ~1_desire~.
1075750	Greetings. I tend my flock and provide guidance to my fellow citizens. I seek not a life full of profit. For to strive for personal recognition or social position is not a worthy cause. A humble man is happy with his place.
1075749	I doth have a similar cloak.
1075748	*gasp* A ~1_desire~, 'tis perfect. I doth have plans for this. Here, I have no need for this ~2_gift~ now.
1075747	I have no need for this ~1_gift~. For the right item, I would trade it.
1075746	One ~1_desire~ wilt make my life so much nicer.
1075745	Good tidings to thee. I live on scraps in the shadow of Lord British's Castle. I am so close to nothing, that surely, thou canst not help but see I live a humble life.
1075744	The cloak thou wearest looks warm.
1075743	Ah, thank you! This ~1_desire~ is just what I needed. Please taketh this ~2_gift~ - I hope it will be of use to thee.
1075742	If I ever receive that which I need, I wilt gladly trade it for this ~1_gift~.
1075741	All I need is but a simple ~1_desire~.
1075740	Hello friend. Yes, I work with yon horses each day. I carry bails of hay, feed, and even shovel manure for those beautiful beasts of burden. Everyone who rideth my animals enjoy their temperament and health. Yet, I do not ask for any recognition.
1075739	A horse blanket would offer more comfort than thine cloak, mayhaps.
1075738	There art no less than seven 'humble citizens' spread across the Britannia proper. I know that they can be found in the towns of Minoc, Skara Brae and Britain. Another may be upon an island at sea, the name of which escapes me at the moment. Thou needeth visit all seven to solve the puzzle. Be diligent, for they have a tendency to wander about.<BR><BR><br>Dost thou wear the plain grey cloak?

3010159	Plants have hit points much like your character.  A plant loses hit points when it is affected by various maladies.  If a plant has <a href="?53">insects</a> eating at it, then it will lose hit points each day.  Other maladies that can affect a plant's health include under or over-<a href="?61">watering</a> the plant, harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>, <a href="?57">poison</a>, and <a href="?59">disease</a>.<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal potions</a> and a plant's natural healing will raise the plant's hit points back up to its maximum, but only if the plant has been cured of all maladies first.<BR><BR>If a plant loses all its hit points, it will die.<BR><BR>As a plant grows, its maximum health increases.  Seeds and saplings are very weak, and can easily be killed if neglected for even a short while.  Full-grown plants, on the other hand, could survive for several days without any help.

Weapons, <a href="?35">Magic</a>, and allies can all be used to slay your foe, and should be, for a fight persists until someone runs away, someone dies, or all combatants voluntarily cease fighting.

1014570	I'm a weaver.
1014569	I am a weapons trainer.
1014568	I'm a smith.
1014567	If thou dost need help with first aid, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will. For a small price.
1014566	I am one of the many wandering healers of Britannia.
1014565	I serve food.
1014564	Why I am a veterinarian.
1014563	It will take a steady hand and a sure eye to be a tinker. If thou art willing to learn, then I can help thee.
1014562	I'm a tinker.
1014561	Aye. I have been called thief, rogue and rapscallion and some things far worse, as I am sure thou hast been. Let us not say that again for others might hear and recognize us.
1014560	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014559	I'm the tavernkeeper here.
1014558	I am a tanner in this fine town.
1014557	I am sure I can break my busy schedule to lend thee some instruction, assuming thou hast some coin.
1014556	I'm a tailor.
1014555	If thou art interested in selling an item to me, then thou must give it to me and I'll decide if I need it in my stock. Otherwise, thou can buy anything that I sell here.
1014554	I am a _Job_.  What wouldst thou expect me to sell?,
1014553	I'm a shipwright.
1014552	I tend to the sheep and keep them safe.
1014551	I serve the needs of Magincian nobles.
1014550	I'm a sculptor.
1014549	I'm a humble scrivener.
1014548	I study ancient times and ancient tomes.
1014547	Well, look what I found!
1014546	This will come in handy indeed.
1014545	I've been needing one of these.
1014544	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014543	Ah, this will be useful.
1014542	I'm a sailor, my friend!,
1014541	I am a message carrier.  Pardon me, I need to be running.
1014540	And hello to thee, again.
1014539	And hello again. How may I help thee, _Name_?
1014538	I am the realtor for this town. If thou desires a domicile of thy own, I can help thee.
1014537	Tracking is more of an art than a science, but it begins with a thorough knowledge of the traits and habits of the creature being tracked. I can help thee with that, I think.
1014536	I am a ranger. I spend most of my days in the woods, observing and tracking animals. I hunt that I may eat, and try to live in harmony with the land.
1014535	I'm a cattle rancher.
1014534	I sell general provisions.
1014533	I'm a prisoner!  Can't thou see that?,
1014532	I am a humble servant of the Gods.
1014531	I live on the sea.  'Tis no job, but a life!,
1014530	I am a member of Parliament.
1014529	I am a Paladin of Britannia!,
1014528	I'm the pit overseer.
1014527	No no no, a job is for those who lack money!  Nobility doesn't take jobs.
1014526	Things seem to be going well.
1014525	I'm doing well enough, now.
1014524	I'm a brother at Empath Abbey.
1014523	I am a minter.
1014522	I work in the mines.
1014521	I am a miller.
1014520	I'm the mayor, friend. Welcome to our fair city!,
1014519	If thou hast guild business, thou may bring it to me. I am the guildmaster.
1014518	If thou dost need help with thy mapmaking, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will.
1014517	I am a mapmaker. Wouldst thou like to learn to make maps? In theory, 'tis simple - find a blank map, go to the spot thou wouldst map, and map it. In practice, of course, this requires a bit of skill ...
1014516	If thou dost need help with thy magic, just ask me to teach thee and I will. For a small price.
1014515	I am a wizard, a weaver of spells.
1014514	I am a laborer, and working is how I spend my days.
1014513	I'm a judge of the High Court of Britannia.
1014512	I'm a maker of fine jewelry.
1014511	I'm the jailkeeper.
1014510	Stand back, I do not wish to be seen so near to thee.
1014509	Thy nearness offends me.
1014508	I am an innkeeper.
1014507	I am an innkeeper.
1014506	I have some horses here that I could sell to thee.
1014505	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee some alchemy skills. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014504	I sell many fragrant dried herbs and flowers.
1014503	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about first aid. I could teach thee, also, about the human anatomy. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.
1014502	I am one of the many healers of Britannia. I also sell potions and healing scrolls.
1014501	If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about such things as camping in the wild. Or not being seen when thou dost not WANT to be seen. Thou wouldst need to pay me, thou knowest.
1014500	I'm a wanderer, and take whatever fortune offers me.
1014499	I am a guard.
1014498	Hello!
1014497	Hello, my friend!  How may I assist thee?,
1014496	Yes?,
1014495	Greetings.  What might I help thee with?,
1014494	Greetings.  What might I do for thee?,
1014493	I'm a glassblower.
1014492	I could show thee a few things that the local guard wouldn't much take to, I'm sure.
1014491	I'm a gamer by trade.  The cards and dice are my partners.
1014490	I can teach thee about the animals in the forest and how to know more about them, if thou art willing.
1014489	My trade is selling pelts of all sorts.
1014488	I can give thee some fishing tips, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And I do expect to be paid for my time.
1014487	I am a fisherman.
1014486	I've been known to teach a select few how to improve their fighting, for a few coins.
1014485	I am paid to fight!,
1014484	I am a simple farmer. I raise crops.
1014483	Help me to understand thee, for I know not what thou seekest.
1014482	Sadly, I must report that I know nothing of what thou speakest.
1014481	Begging thy pardon, but in my awe at seeing thee actually here before me, I neglected to listen closely to what thou spoke.
1014480	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014479	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014478	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014477	If I look perplexed, 'tis because I am.
1014476	Excuse me? Forgive my lack of comprehension.
1014475	Forgive me, but I do not understand.
1014474	I am sorry, but I do not always understand the utterances of petty criminals.
1014473	Excuse my incomprehension, oh mighty terrorizer of small children, but I did not understand thee, and would find life more pleasant without thy ilk nearby.
1014472	I wish I could answer thee, so that thou wouldst leave me alone.
1014471	Begging thy pardon, but I fail to understand what it is that thou wantest.
1014470	I do not understand thee--I am sure it must be my fault, however.
1014469	I beg thee, do not harm me. I cannot help thee.
1014468	I do not understand.
1014467	Excuse me?,
1014466	Pardon me?,
1014465	I've been known to teach some how to improve their cookin', for a few coins.
1014464	I am a cook and baker.
1014463	I am listening to thee.
1014462	What is it thou wishest?
1014461	Thou hast mine attention.
1014460	Thou wishest to speak with me?
1014459	May the rest of thy day be pleasant.
1014458	Goodbye, stranger.
1014457	Fare thee well.
1014456	I'm a cobbler.
1014455	I can give thee some practice in our art, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014454	A Cashual is one who has a deep understanding of the practical applications of natural philosophy.
1014453	I can give thee some practice in carpentry, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.
1014452	I'm the carpenter here.
1014451	I am a butcher.
1014450	I am sort of like a porter. I lighten the burdens of rich travelers.
1014449	I'm a bowyer by trade.
1014448	I've been a smith for a good number of years.
1014447	I'm between jobs at the moment. But if thou couldst find it in thine heart to help out a soul in need, I'm sure that my luck will change!
1014446	I'm a beekeeper.
1014445	I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.
1014444	If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.
1014443	Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.
1014442	I am a bard. A minstrel. A thoughtful troubadour.
1014441	I am a Banker.
1014440	Yes, I'm the baker. How can I help thee?
1014439	I am an artist.
1014438	I've been known to teach some how to improve their skills, for a few coins.
1014437	I'm an armourer.
1014436	I am an architect.
1014435	I train animals.
1014434	I am an alchemist.
1014433	Dost thou need to improve thy alchemy? Sure, I might be able to teach thee.
1014432	Yew, thou hast found, is in the northwest region of Britannia.
1014431	Yew is famous for its wood crafts. There is a woodwork shop near the bakery, just a bit south of the bowyer.
1014430	We do have a baker, and a fine one at that. To find the bakery, find the market near the center of Yew. The baker hangs his sign between that of the butcher and the woodworker.
1014429	There is a prison storehouse between the High Court and the prison.
1014428	The vineyards and winery are just south of the abbey, to the east of the flour mill and across the little inlet.
1014427	The prison is past the High Court to the northwest ... although it is not a common tourist site. Usually people come here for the wine.
1014426	The monks in the abbey that lies to the northeast spend their time studying painting, sculpting, prose, poetry, music ... and wine.
1014425	The healers in Yew are specialized in natural cures. There are at least two in town: one is southeast and one is central.
1014424	The cemetery is to the south and east of town.
1014423	It was decided a long time ago that local judges would sit on the High Court. If thou wishes to see the court, head west and north of town. I cannot say if there is a trial in progress, however.
1014422	If thou'rt handy with a bow and arrows, then surely thou'lt be interested in our bowyer's excellent work. Look in his shop at the center of town ... there a selection that'll make thy head spin.
1014421	If thou hast grain to be milled, take it to the flour mill just a bit west of the Abbey.
1014420	Fresh vegetables and other nourishing foods are sold at the market in the center of town. Look for a shop close by the butcher and baker.
1014419	Fresh meat can be had from the butcher, in the clearing at the center of Yew.
1014418	Yew is in the northwest region of Britannia. It is home to the Empath Abbey where the famous wine is made.
1014417	Thou canst purchase thy supplies from the provisioner, found south and west from the northwestern inn.
1014416	This is Wind, of course. We study all manner of things: magic, the world, the inexplicable self.
1014415	Tailor made clothes and repairs thou canst find at the tailor's shop, east of the provisioner.
1014414	Skara Brae is on an island due west of Britain. They study a mental form of magic that is unusual for that part of the world.
1014413	Serpent's Hold is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes. It is where all the fighters of Britannia are trained.
1014412	Our only supply of reagents are sold in the central part of Wind. Look close by the libraries, in the same general location of the healer.
1014411	Our libraries are filled with scholars grazing on information. Look to the center of Wind for our collected tomes of knowledge.
1014410	Moonglow is on the southern tip of Verity isle, and is a very logical place. They buy other cities' technology and examine it to see how it works. Laudable.
1014409	Minoc is in the northmost part of the realm, a bit to the east. It is in the mountains, and is economically dependent on the nearby ore mines.
1014408	Magincia is an island city east of Britain. It is all pride and foolishness, for it has never known deprivation.
1014407	Lord British is the ruler of Britannia. He seems a kind and just king, trying to do the right thing for his people.
1014406	Lord British became ruler of the united realm of Britannia when he wrested control from the 'evil' Lord Robert. The stories that are mostly known are, of course, mostly apocryphal.
1014405	Labs are places of study and discovery. We've one to the northwest of Wind, and one to the east.
1014404	Inns are scattered throughout Wind. One is northwest, one is northeast, and one is south.
1014403	If thou needest a healer, look to the eastern central part of wind. 'Tis close by the food place, if thou knowest where that is, but farther south and west.
1014402	Food is a necessity, but certainly nothing to waste time over. Our communal eating area is to the far east of Wind.
1014401	Vesper, thou canst see, is on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014400	Thou'rt looking for the butcher, I take it. Get thee to the docks, then take the bridge north from that island. The butcher is the first building thou'lt see.
1014399	Thou'lt find the Miners' Guildhouse on the northernmost island, just where the river breaks around Vesper.
1014398	Thou'lt find the blacksmith on the largest of the southern isles.
1014397	Thou'lt be wanting supplies, I take it? The provisioner keeps a shop to the north of town, on the shore.
1014396	Thou might try one of the center islands, away to the west. Methinks I've seen a bowyer's sign hanging there.
1014395	There's a fine tailor's shop in Vesper. Look to the largest southern island, in the building just north of the warriors' guildhouse.
1014394	There is naught but fresh fish in Vesper, and 'tis easiest had from the fisherman's shop. Look near the baker and butcher's places.
1014393	There are mages who will sell their talents, true enough. Merely look on the ground floor of their guildhall on the north island.
1014392	There are a fair number of sorcerers here, and that's a fact. They meet in the upper floors of their hall on the north island.
1014391	The woodworker's shop can be found but one bridge north of the healer's island.
1014390	The tavern is on one of the southern islands, I believe toward the center. I see it when I run errands to the customs house.
1014389	The tanner is one bridge away from shore, at the point farthest south of the city.
1014388	The tailor is on the eastern shore of the river. Take the bridge from the northern isle and then go south.
1014387	The soldiers and fighters gather in their hall on the large southern island.
1014386	The shipwright is the nearest building to the docks, o'course!
1014385	The jeweler keeps shop on the northern island, betwixt the miners' and bards' guild halls.
1014384	The farmer brings his produce in from the fields and sells it from his shop on the island just north of the docks.
1014383	The best artist's studio, and by coincidence the only one, is on the northern isle, near the guild houses.
1014382	The bee hives are kept on a small islet at the northeast. 'Tis north of the butcher and baker, and east of the painter's studio.
1014381	The baker's place is on the island just north of the docks.
1014380	Our tinker's shop can be found on a central island, somewhat north.
1014379	Our mortuary and crypts are on the western bank, north of the inn.
1014378	Our healer has trained with the best, friend, as will be more than able to ease thy suffering. Look on a small island, just one bridge east of the blacksmith, or one bridge south of the woodworker.
1014377	Our bank is on the northmost island. Look for the jeweler and the painter's studio.
1014376	On the western shore, at the southern end of Vesper, is an inn. It is much the same as the inn on the south-central island.
1014375	On the centermost island, farthest to the east, thou canst find the Seaman's guild.
1014374	On a lazy afternoon I like to wander around in Vesper's museum. It is the large building east of the tanner.
1014373	Lookin' for the Bards' Guild? 'Tis the southernmost building on the northernmost island of Vesper.
1014372	If thou'rt looking for potions, the shop thou needest is to the far north of Vesper, on the same island as the Jeweler.
1014371	If thou'rt in need of armour, look on the central westernmost island of Vesper.
1014370	If I knew there was a thieves guild, I'd tell the guards first!
1014369	I hope thou hast had no trouble in Vesper, friend. The town hall is a southern island, one door south of the warriors' guild.
1014368	I can tell thee that our mage buys reagents from the reagent shop near the docks. The stuff comes from all over, and Vesper gets first pick-through.
1014367	Customs is in the very southeast part of Vesper.
1014366	You can't get fish fresher than at our fish market. It is outside the city gates, on the sea side.
1014365	We have two inns, one at the easternmost part of town, and one in the west, a bit to the north.
1014364	We have guardhouses at most strategic locations: especially wall corners with good visibility.
1014363	We have but one healer, and too far a walk from the training grounds, to my mind. If thou hast wounds, look to the south of the commercial district.
1014362	We have a very fine mage indeed. Thou canst find him just north of the inn, above the Traveler's Gate.
1014361	To find the shrine, simply walk to the point most north and east of town. 'Tis close to the water.
1014360	Thou'rt looking to train? The training salle is just inside the Soldier's Gate.
1014359	Thou'rt in Trinsic, of course, near the Cape of Heroes we are.
1014358	There's a guild or two in Trinsic. The Fisher Guild is to the southeast, and the Engineer's Guild is to the northwest. The Paladins' Guild is on their island, of course.
1014357	There's a good weaponsmith in the center of town, just a few paces south of the Soldier's Gate.
1014356	The tavern is just west of the fork in the river.
1014355	The tailor's shop is a bit apart from the others. It is a bit south and east of the river's fork.
1014354	The stables are just a pace to the west of the inn.
1014353	The paladins who live in Trinsic call the barracks home. They are in the northern part of the eastern half of town.
1014352	The paladins meet in their guildhall, found on the eastern side of their island.
1014351	The monastery is renowned for its serene gardens. 'Tis on thy left as thou comes into the city.
1014350	The mayor lives in the north side of town, betwixt the armourer and the monastery.
1014349	The Guild of Engineers meets in their hall in the northwest section of town.
1014348	The butcher's shop is in the southeast corner of Trinsic.
1014347	The armour shop is north of the monastery and mayor's house. I think you'll be pleased with the selection.
1014346	Our provisioner's shop is the first thing one sees coming into the city. 'Tis the large building to the south of the entrance gate.
1014345	Our Engineers' Guild is in the northwest corner of town.
1014344	Our baker is in the southern part of the city, just to the south and east of the Traveler's Gate.
1014343	If thou'rt looking for the Fishers' Guild, go to the farthest part of the city to the southeast. The guildhall is next to the fish market.
1014342	If thou hast a mind to see a tinker, the shop is in the southern part of the city ... just follow the river up to where it enters the city, and thou'lt find the place.
1014341	Fine gems are the trade of our master jeweler, who has set up shop on the south side of our commercial district, neighboring the baker and the healer.
1014340	Any thieves or other such riffraff are incarcerated in the Constabulary, just north of the Traveler's Gate.
1014339	Woodcrafter? That shop is toward the north of town, center between the weaponsmith and the farmers' shop.
1014338	We've a fine shipwright, close on to the southernmost dock.
1014337	Weapons can be had from the shop in the north-east corner of town.
1014336	Town Hall, eh? Well, and I hope thou bring no trouble to our fair isle. Walk west and south to get there.
1014335	Thou hast a choice. There is one guild on the northwest side of town, and another just across the water to the east.
1014334	This is fine country for growing food. Our farmers sell at a shop near the northern edge of town, toward the middle and just south of the theatre.
1014333	There is a shop of gentle magics, and that's a fact. 'Tis very near the exact center of town.
1014332	The tavern sits on the western shore. It is just north of Town Hall
1014331	The rangers' guildhall is on the west side of the isle. 'Tis north of the tavern and Town Hall, y'know.
1014330	The clothier keeps his shop on the east shore, three doors north of the dock.
1014329	The butcher shop is in the midst of town, betwixt the tavern and the magic shop.
1014328	The bowyer is north and a little west of the inn. In my opinion, the work is excellent.
1014327	The beekeeper has a shop toward the north of town, just south of the theatre.
1014326	The armourer is toward the center of town, but off a bit to the north-west.
1014325	The animal trainer sets up shop just north of the beekeeper. They are much the same thing, to my mind.
1014324	The alchemist's shop is the very most northeast place in town.
1014323	Our theatre is on the northern edge of town, just a bit north and east of the beekeeper.
1014322	Our inn is at the south end of the isle, near the docks, o'course.
1014321	Our healer is close to the east dock.
1014320	Our fair city of Skara Brae is the central hub for all the westward sea expeditions.
1014319	Not settling down, I take it. Thou'lt find the provisioner to the northwest of the inn.
1014318	Just north of the healer is where our blacksmith keeps shop.
1014317	Farmers come into town, but their crops are all a bit over on the mainland.
1014316	Cartographer's are usually found sharing space with shipwrights.
1014315	Thou'lt find the healer's place between the armoury and the tavern. 'Tis sometimes crowded, especially right after training.
1014314	The tinker's place is on the mainland. Thou'lt find it closest to the bridge.
1014313	The tavern faces the healer's shop, immediately on thy left as thou comes in over the bridge.
1014312	The stables are on the mainland side of Serpent's Hold, betwixt the tailor and the tinker.
1014311	The inn is on the west side of the island, close to the main gate.
1014310	The heart of Serpent's Hold is the Keep. It is the largest building on the island, in the northwest corner.
1014309	The blacksmith works in one of the large buildings central in the Hold. The smithy is the northernmost of the two.
1014308	Serpent's Hold, thou hast found, is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes.
1014307	'Serpent's Hold Meats' is on the shore of the mainland, east of the bridge.
1014306	Our provisioner can set thee up with supplies. Look just to the north of the blacksmith.
1014305	I've been pleased with our armourer's work. Look for the shop called 'Serpent's Arms', just east of the healer.
1014304	All manner of clothing can be found on the mainland side. The tailor's shop is just west from the stables.
1014303	Wilt thou hear sweet music? We have a beautiful concert hall in the north of the city, next door to the customs house. There's a conservatory for bards across the street, should you wish to study further.
1014302	We have both a renowned conservatory and concert hall. Thou'lt find both to the north of town, between the customs house and the casino.
1014301	Travelers from less civilized towns often mistake the large building in the center of town for a palace. But, 'tis merely a manor house, and the man who lords over it made his fortune here in Nujel'm.
1014300	Thou'lt find the Mystical Spirits on the eastern edge of town, next door to the casino. But if thou permit me to say, I prefer The Silver Bow, which is just a few paces south of it. Better atmosphere.
1014299	Thou'lt find the jail near the merchant's guild, south of the human chessboard. I'd be wary if I wert thee - 'tis one thing to be on this side of the bars down there, but 'tis a nightmare on the other.
1014298	Thou'lt find the customs house overlooking the northeast bay. 'Tis inside the city walls, next door to the concert hall.
1014297	There's but one bank in Nujel'm, and it lies in the southeastern quarter of town, not too far from the human chessboard.
1014296	The jeweler's shop is in the northeast corner of town, east of the conservatory and north of the casino.
1014295	So, 'tis the merchant's guild thou'lt be seeking? Art interested in trade in human flesh, then? For that's what thou'lt find there. 'Tis at the southern tip of town, next the jail.
1014294	Seek'st thou a gaming house? The try the casino in the northeast quarter, next door to the Mystical Spirits. I think thou'lt find Nujel'm lives up to her reputation.
1014293	Our inn is called Restful Slumber, and 'tis fairly true to name. Thou'lt find it in the southeastern quarter of town, neighboring The Silver Bow tavern. I wish a pleasant stay.
1014292	Needst thou a tailor? Thou canst not find one better than ours ... Thou'lt find the shop along the eastern edge of town, next door to the Mystical Spirits tavern.
1014291	If thou'rt looking to buy or sell something, there's a mall to the west of the city, where thou'lt find almost everything - blacksmith, boyer, weaponsmith, tanner, food and supplies.
1014290	If thou'rt in search of sustenance, thou'lt find two taverns in the east of town - Mystical Spirits and the Silver Bow.
1014289	If thou seekst to buy or sell goods, most tradespeople keep shops in the mall at the far west end of town. If thou'rt merely hungry, thou canst get a good meal at The Silver Bow or Mystical Spirits.
1014288	If the idea of a human chessboard appeals to thee, thou'lt find ours at the southern end of the road through the center of town, past the town manor and the inn.
1014287	Dost thou mean the gazebo? The little open-air wooden structure on the southeast side of town? 'Tis between The Silver Bow tavern and Restful Slumber inn.
1014286	Aye, The Silver Bow. 'Tis a bit quieter than Mystical Spirits, I'll tell that that. 'Tis further from the casino than Mystical Spirits, just south of the concert hall. Draws a milder crowd.
1014285	And why wouldst thou be needing a cemetery? Sure, thou'rt neither so old, nor so ill? Well, thou'lt find it to the far northwest, outside the city walls.
1014284	We have a mage who deals in potions and other such things. Look a bit south of the tailor, just to the northeast of the teleporters.
1014283	We are on Verity Isle. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014282	Thou should stop and take a look at the woodcarver's wares. Thou'lt find the store just north and a bit west from the main teleporter location. The skill and detail work are, I think, second to none.
1014281	Thou canst guess from our city's name that our scholars are intrigued by celestial objects. In the eastern part of the city, near the shore, we have the realms' largest eyeglass pointed at the sky.
1014280	There is one apprentice for each Mages' Guild. Therefore, one is to be found near the northern Guild, one near the southern Guild, and one to the east.
1014279	The inn is east a ways from the docks, a bit south. If thou sees the Artists' Guild, thou art too far east. If thou finds the scholar mage's place, thou art too far south.
1014278	The herbalist is found but one door south of the shop of reagents. Theirs customers are similar, but their businesses do not conflict as often as thou might suspect.
1014277	The Gadgeteers' Guild is in the heart of the city, to the southeast of the teleporters.
1014276	The docks are easy enough to get to ... they are north of the city proper, and in betwixt the two 'prongs' that extend north into the sea.
1014275	The cemetery is found to the south of the city. It is a small one, but strikingly serene.
1014274	The butcher is across the street from the herbalist. If thou'rt lost, both meat and herbs are to the west of the central teleporters.
1014273	The best place in Moonglow to buy supplies would be at the provisioner's shop, just south of the docks.
1014272	The artists live near their guildhall. If thou'rt interested in visiting Moonglow's bastion of the finer arts, look to the east of the main town area. The artists are close by where the road turns northward.
1014271	Teleporters? Well, there's one near the Lycaeum, of course, one by the zoo, one near the eastern residence section, and one near the northern houses.
1014270	Reagents are quite in demand in Moonglow. There is a store devoted to their sale, close by the teleporters.
1014269	Our tailor has a central location, just across the street from the provisioner.
1014268	Our healer is in the central part of Moonglow, on the far western side. It is but two doors away from the teleporters, and that's a good thing, I promise.
1014267	North of the Gadgeteers' Guild is a mage scholar who will teach travelers his lore, regardless of whether they attend the Lycaeum.
1014266	Moonglow was founded by Lord British to be a research colony. The Lycaeum is where the research takes place. Nearly all new magic in Britain comes from that building on the northwest peninsula.
1014265	Master mages are usually professors at the Lycaeum. They can be found there, or in their homes, or sometimes about the streets of Moonglow. They are usually willing to answer questions.
1014264	Indeed, Moonglow has several Mages' Guilds. Three in fact. One to the south, one to the east and one to the north.
1014263	If thou'rt looking for the town hall, look to the southwest corner of the heart of Moonglow.
1014262	If it were not for the zoo in southern Moonglow, the mages would have to trek into the wilds to view these humble creatures ... and grass stains make for angry apprentices.
1014261	Fresh fruit can be had at a humble store near the center of town. It is just south of the inn, if thou'rt interested.
1014260	Fine armour can be had from the armoury in the center of town. Look to the west of Moonglow, to one side of the street that leads west out of town.
1014259	All manner of baked goods can be found just south of the docks.
1014258	We think pretty highly of our armourer. His shop in the southeast corner of town has brisk business.
1014257	We have two guilds: the Warriors' and the Miners'.
1014256	We have but one tanner, and thou'lt find the shop south, but not so far as the provisioner.
1014255	Thou'rt lookin' for the blacksmith? The smithy is on the far side of town from the stables.
1014254	Thou'lt find our tinker in the center of Minoc.
1014253	The woodworker has a good selection of material in these parts. The shop is on the east side of town, just a bit of wander north of the tanner.
1014252	The tavern is in the north part of town, near to the butcher and warriors' guild.
1014251	The mines are due east of town.
1014250	The horses are kept a bit apart from the town. The stable is north, just northeast of the tavern.
1014249	The butcher's shop is at the very northwest corner of Minoc.
1014248	Supplies are a steady business in Minoc. We have a provisioner on both the north and south sides of town.
1014247	Soldiers and professional fighters all gather in their hall, which is near center of town, one door south of the tavern.
1014246	Our healer's shop is in the southeastern corner of town.
1014245	Minoc is not so large a city that we must separate the homes from the businesses. Houses are throughout the town.
1014244	Minoc is about thee. There is not much north of here, friend.
1014243	Miners' tents are east and south of town. They stay close to the mines, mostly.
1014242	I do not know of a place called 'Buccaneer's Den'.
1014241	Dancing is a sport in Minoc. Sometimes the music is louder than the blacksmith's anvil next door.
1014240	Both Miners' Guild halls are near the center of town.
1014239	Thou canst purchase magical goods in the southern end of the city along the central street.
1014238	There's a warehouse that stocks all kinds of goods on the east side of the city near the tinker's shop.
1014237	The tinker's shop is located just south of the steps leading toward the town square on the north end of town.
1014236	The temple is located near the beach to the far north, just east of the town square.
1014235	The shipwrights, why 'tis located on the south side of the city on the docks.
1014234	The provisioner shares space with the fish market. 'Tis located on the city docks on the far south end of the city.
1014233	The pirates of Buccaneer's Den resent our wealth, but hath begun to raid less and less often thanks to magical items of protection purchased from Moonglow.
1014232	The people of Magincia are direct descendants of those who forged the world, and one day we will inherit the world, and make our way to the stars and take our place as the rulers of all the lands below. We have good cause to be proud.
1014231	The miner's guild is located on the western edge of town, behind the inn.
1014230	The merchants meet in the building behind the fish market. 'Tis near the docks on the south side of the city.
1014229	The local inn is located nearly in the exact centre of the city. A small park lies to the north of it.
1014228	The jeweler's shop is located on the far west side of the city, between the Miner's Guild Hall and the tailor's shop.
1014227	The healer's hall is on the westernmost street in the city, toward the southern end, near the tailor's and the fish market.
1014226	The fish market is located on the city's docks, on the south side.
1014225	The docks are located on the far south side of the city.
1014224	The best tailor is located next to the shipwrights on the far southwest side of the city.
1014223	The bakery is located on the southeastern tip of the main island before you cross the bridge to Parliament.
1014222	Parliament doth consist of a nine member council. The retiring council member hath the responsibility of appointing their replacement.
1014221	New Magincia? 'Tis nothing wrong with this fine city ... we do not need a new one.
1014220	Many a great speech hath been heard in the town square in the north of the city, beside the temple.
1014219	Magic doth provide a variety of conveniences. But 'tis more a variant of technology than the manipulation of ether, that keeps our houses clean without having to work at it.
1014218	Artists are rare in Magincia. We import most of our artwork. 'Tis too much work and effort to create it ourselves.
1014217	Above the magic shop located in the southern part of the city, the mage's guild has a lovely meeting hall.
1014216	A small island southeast of the main city, is where the council meets in the House of Parliament.
1014215	A fine tavern is located in the southeast section of the city, near the bakery.
1014214	We have two. One south of town, and one on the southern isle.
1014213	We do have blacksmith shops, one north of the city, just west of Town Hall, and another to the south, near the southern docks.
1014212	Town tavern? 'Tis a grand place for ale and perhaps a brawl or two. I recommend it. Head east from the Dueling Pit, and when thou smellest fish, turn right.
1014211	Town Hall? Find the Dueling Pits, near the center of town, then head a few paces north and east.
1014210	Thou wilt find a provisioner on the eastern side of the main town, midway between northmost and southmost.
1014209	Thou canst find him to the west of town, past the clothier and the Thieves' Guild.
1014208	The Theater is on the southern isle.
1014207	The tailor? That shop is on the southern island. It's a small island, but still Jhelom, right enough.
1014206	The shipwright is nearest the town's eastern docks, but south of the armourer.
1014205	The Healer? Why close on to the Dueling Pit, of course!
1014204	The guard tower is south of the Dueling Pit, on the far side of the library.
1014203	The Fisher's Guild is the most southern thing in the town, friend.
1014202	The clothes shop is to the southwest of town, betwixt the jeweler and the Thieves' Guild.
1014201	The best place to buy fish is found just east of the Dueling Pit.
1014200	The baker is north of the Weapons shop, west of the Dueling Pit.
1014199	Sure, every fighter is interested in armor. My favorite is the nearest building to the eastern gate. There's another, too, at the south end of town.
1014198	Ranches are on the north-most island.
1014197	Our tinker is north and east of the main isle's southern gate.
1014196	Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, of course!
1014195	Library? We've got one, friend, and it's just south of the Dueling Pit.
1014194	Last I saw, there was a mage's shop just north of the theater. That's on the southern isle, thou knowest.
1014193	Jhelom is any mercenary's second home. 'Tis no finer place for selling thy sword arm. While it's still attached, at least.
1014192	Indeed, the Fighters' Guild is in Jhelom. In fact, there are two. One is at the northern edge of the town, just west of the blacksmith. One is the farthest building south.
1014191	In my opinion, we have a fine woodworker. I'd call his shop south-central, though 'tis a bit to the east.
1014190	I'm told our weapons shop is one of the best. It is west and south from the Dueling Pit.
1014189	I'll not ask thy business at the Thieves' Guild. 'Tis just south of the Dueling Pit, beneath the Library.
1014188	If thou art looking for Jhelom's inn, it is north of the main southern docks.
1014187	Food can be most easily purveyed from the small shop a bit north and east of the town's southern docks.
1014186	Docks? Why, there are no less than four docks in Jhelom. One to the east of the main town, and one to the south, another on our northernmost island, and one on our southernmost isle.
1014185	Cemetery? We've got one, sadly a necessity, and it's to the far west of town.
1014184	A bit of action, eh? The Dueling Pit is in the center of town, of course.
1014183	We have a small dock. 'Tis on the north side of town, right on the water, o'course.
1014182	This is Cove, friend. Not as fancy as a big city town, but a good place, with good people.
1014181	The orcs live safe in their fortress to the south, and when they set out, we have no warning.
1014180	The orcs are bolder here than they dare elsewhere. They come from the fort to the south.
1014179	Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.
1014178	Our armourer is a fine hand with metal and leather. Feel free to view his wares in his shop two or three doors north of the healer.
1014177	If thou'rt in need of medical attention, there is none better to visit than our healer on the southern side of our village.
1014176	I know many virtuous people.
1014175	Yew ... ahh, that is near to Empath Abbey. That's the land from whence the best wine comes.
1014174	Vesper can be found on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.
1014173	Verity Isle is Moonglow's whereabouts. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.
1014172	Trinsic? 'Tis near the Cape of Heroes, I think.
1014171	Thou'rt in Buccaneer's Den.
1014170	The woodworker is next to the blacksmith.
1014169	The taverns are south, west of the provisioner.
1014168	The tanner set up shop south of the healer.
1014167	The provisioner is southmost in town.
1014166	The blacksmith is to the northwest, past the bath house.
1014165	Skara Brae? Thou canst not get more west than that!
1014164	Right beside the woodworker and blacksmith, thou'lt find our bathhouse.
1014163	Our inn is up past the northern bridge.
1014162	Our healer sets to the east side, between the two bridges. If thou seest the inn, thou hast gone too far north.
1014161	Ocllo ... hmmm. 'Tis an island, I believe.
1014160	Nujel'm is an island city. Part of Britannia, but ... different.
1014159	Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.
1014158	I've never seen Lord British myself.
1014157	If thou'rt looking for Trinsic, 'tis south, but along the eastern coast.
1014156	I may have heard a legend of a city called Wind. It was in the mountains, if I recall.
1014155	I know nothing of any avatar.
1014154	Healing shrines are found all about Britannia.
1014153	Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.
1014152	Britain thou'rt askin' about? I'm told 'tis the biggest city in the land. Don't see what all t'fuss is about. The size of hereabouts is plenty big for me.
1014151	Aye, we have a tanner. He's in the center o' town.
1014150	Wilt thou stand back a bit
1014149	Why standest thou so near to me?
1014148	Well, well, what have we here?
1014147	Vesper? 'Tis a city in northeastern Britannia. Ore from the mines of Minoc are sent down river to be unloaded in Vesper.
1014146	Various issues surface from time to time, such as taxation, invasion, protection form creatures of the wild.
1014145	Tis very generous of thee.
1014144	Tis very generous of thee, but I don't need it.
1014143	Tis the bay that touches the city of Britain.
1014142	Thou'rt welcome.
1014141	Though a kind and generous man in his youth, Lord Robere thirsted for power in his later years, so legends say.  Had not the Order of the Silver Serpent been ready to fight for Lord British, this very land could have belonged to the ambitious conqueror.
1014140	Thou shouldst learn to use the moongates if thou dost plan to travel far. The key is in the phases of the moons.
1014139	Thou shouldst be able to get kindling from any wood thou finds. If thou has an axe, of course.
1014138	Thou can sell feathers from birds to a bowyer. And a cook may purchase the bird itself from thee.
1014137	Thou can find a good deal of treasure under Britannia. Look to the caves and what thou call dungeons.
1014136	Thou art nearer to me than I like.
1014135	Thou art most kind, but it isn't anything that I need.
1014134	Thou art most kind!
1014133	This will come in handy indeed.
1014132	There are many as yet unmapped places beneath Britannia. 'Tis rumored to be riches and magic in them. And creatures that will rend the flesh from thy bones.
1014131	The name is familiar to me... ah, yes -- I believe he is the infrequent guest of Lord British. Mayhaps thou wilt find him sampling the local spirits.
1014130	The moongates? They are... doors to different parts of Britannia. Except the destinations of the doors change with the phases of the two moons.
1014129	Thank thee. Don't need any.
1014128	Thank thee, but I don't want it.
1014127	Thank thee!
1014126	Tanners will buy hides and pelts that thou dost take from the animals thou dost hunt.
1014125	Shrines to the virtues are spread around our land. I've heard that they can even resurrect the dead.
1014124	Right here.
1014123	Please, keep it. I don't want it.
1014122	Please back away a bit.
1014121	Our moons are called Trammel and Felucca. They control the moongates.
1014120	Only the bravest knights belong to the Order of the Silver Serpent. 'Twas they who defeated the forces of Lord Robere.
1014119	Not a problem.
1014118	Lord Shamino? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014117	Lord Blackthorn wishes the freedom of choice in ALL things extended to everyone. Some say that he'd even sees the Orcs and Lizardmen as equals to the humans in Britannia.
1014116	Let's see... I remember the names of Shame, Wrong, Despise, and Hythloth. I've never owned a map of Britannia myself.
1014115	Just fine.
1014114	I've heard that Lord Blackthorn has written a couple of books describing his philosophies in-depth. If thou dost find these, I imagine thou wouldst be able to say better than I what Blackthorn is about.
1014113	I've been needing one of these.
1014112	It's essential to have good kindling and a bedroll if thou dost want to camp.
1014111	Iolo? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.
1014110	I'm doing relatively well.
1014109	If thou dost want to earn money, practice a skill. Make things and sell them to the public. Most shopkeepers will let thee use the tools and materials that they aren't using.
1014108	If thou dost happen upon some ore, go to the blacksmith's shop and try to craft some armor or weapons. I have heard that it just takes practice.
1014107	If thou can get an axe, perhaps thou could cut some trees into useful boards for woodworkers. They may be willing to pay thee for them.
1014106	If thou art wanting a respite from the rigors of Britannia, then thou can make a camp or check in to an Inn, whichever is the most convenient.
1014105	If thou art able to hunt the wild animals, sometimes thou can sell the meat that thou dost carve from them to a butcher.
1014104	I would not live in Buccaneer's Den if I were thee, for it is home to the most vile men and women to sail the seas.
1014103	I work in the town that thou art in.
1014102	I work here in town.
1014101	I will take it, then.
1014100	I shall be happy to take it!  Thank thee!
1014099	I shall accept with pleasure.
1014098	I really don't need it.
1014097	I live in the town that thou art standing in.
1014096	I live here in _Town_.
1014095	I know not of which thou doth speak.
1014094	I have heard that the great dungeons sometimes have great treasures.
1014093	I don't want it. Sorry.
1014092	I can't take it. Sorry.
1014091	I cannot speak but fondly on my homeland. Yet I would not forgo an opportunity to see other lands.
1014090	I cannot help thee.
1014089	I am well.
1014088	I accept.
1014087	Here.  In Town.
1014086	Hello.
1014085	Greetings.
1014084	Goodbye.
1014083	Farewell.
1014082	Excellent. 'Tis my lucky day.
1014081	Dupre? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe. If thou wert to search for him, I wouldst most recommend a tavern.
1014080	Cove? Thou shouldst find it North and East of Britain.
1014079	Certainly, thou art welcome.
1014078	Britanny Bay is the body of water on the edge of Britannia's capital.
1014077	Bedrolls can be purchased from a provisioner.
1014076	Ah, the weather... 'Tis an interesting thing, really. No matter what the season, no matter what enchantments are cast, our land is almost always blessed with clear and beautiful blue skies.
1014075	Thou can work on thy swordplay at the old keep, south of Lord British's castle.
1014074	Thou can purchase arcane goods at the Sorcerer's Delight - which some call the Mage Tower. It can be found in northern Britain, next to the Conservatory of Music.
1014073	Thou can get to the Sage Advice Magic Shop on the east side of the river.
1014072	Thou can find the Ethral Goods Magic Shop just south of the Main Gate. Next to the Premier Provisioner's shop.
1014071	Thou art in Britain.
1014070	There's the Salty Dog, The Unicorn's Horn, The Cat's Lair, and The Blue Boar taverns, here in Britain.
1014069	There are three or four merchants of the arcane in Britain.
1014068	The Southernmost bridge is called River's Gate.
1014067	The Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects all the farms with Britain proper.
1014066	The Great Northern Bridge is so called because it's the Northern-most bridge in Britain.
1014065	The Cypress Bridge is surrounded on one side by a tailor's shop and on the other by a magic shop.
1014064	The bridge next to the Mage's tower is thus called the Mage's Bridge.
1014063	There are many bridges across the Brittany. There's the Great Northern Bridge at the north-most end, the Mage's Bridge, then the one we call Virtue's Pass. South of that there's Cypress Bridge, and the River's Gate Bridge. And, of course, the Gung-Farmer's Bridge connects Britain with the farmlands to the West.
1014062	Incantations and Enchantments is in the middle of eastern Britain, on the south side of the park.
1014061	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014060	Which sort of smith? Weaponsmith, blacksmith?
1014059	Try the stables beside the Mage Tower.
1014058	Try the bowyer just East of the theatre.
1014057	'Tis the bay on our southern coast.
1014056	'Tis being repaired, but it stands on the promontory o'erlooking Brittany Bay.
1014055	'Tis an expensive place, but the Unicorn Horn, overlooking the ocean on the east side, serves a decent ale.
1014054	Thou canst see that the old city walls are of a different vintage stone than the castle proper. 'Twas built before the current castle buildings.
1014053	Thou canst purchase clothes on the East side of the river, near the Cypress Bridge.
1014052	Thou canst buy weapons at the blacksmith's shop.
1014051	There's a baker on the market square before the castle gate.
1014050	There is an armourer's shop beside the Mage Gate. Just South of the old city wall.
1014049	There is a plague of orcs on the western side of the farms--if thou seekest their encampments, that is the place to look.
1014048	There is a Mining Guild beside the city library.
1014047	There is a leatherworker's shop facing the market square.
1014046	There is a jeweler's just to the South of the Artist's guild.
1014045	There is a healer on the market square, near the Main Gate.
1014044	There is a blacksmith beside the castle moat on the northern edge of town.
1014043	There be a guildhall for the artisans of the town outside the old walls, south of the Armorer's.
1014042	There are two guardhouses. One near the Gung-Farmer's Bridge, and the other next to Virtue's Pass.
1014041	There are two gates in the old city walls. The Poor Gate, and the Main Gate are the names.
1014040	There are many guilds in this city. 'Tis the benefit of living in Lord British's capital.
1014039	The weapons trainer? Ah, that is on the north edge of town, on the eastern bank of the river. 'Tis called the Cavalry Guild.
1014038	The Wayfarer's Inn is beside the Mage's Gate, on the East side of the river.
1014037	The waterfront is what many call everything south of the old city wall. Properly speaking, it runneth along the river from River's Gate Bridge, down along the water to the Oaken Oar and the Narrows.
1014036	The Warrior's Guild is housed in the Old Keep.
1014035	The Salty Dog is a tavern overlooking the park, right next to The Wayfarer's Inn.
1014034	The ocean is to the south of Britain.
1014033	The Oaken Oar houses excellent shipwrights. It is on the waterfront by the mouth of the Narrow Neck.
1014032	The Northside Inn is situated on the lake that surrounds Blackthorn's Castle.
1014031	The Main Gate divides the central city from the waterfront.
1014030	The Mage Tower is the building with all the arches, made of grey stone, on the north side of the town.
1014029	The guildhall of the Mechanicians, or the Tinkers as some call them, is right beside Poor Gate.
1014028	The First Bank of Britain lies next to the jeweler's, beside the moat.
1014027	The farms in this area are all in the countryside, to the west of Lord British's castle. Thou must cross the Narrows and follow the road there.
1014026	The Customs office checks imported goods. 'Tis on the waterfront.
1014025	The city's sole veterinarian lives by the river, by the Mage's Bridge.
1014024	The center of the musical arts in Britain is the Bardic Conservatory on the north side of town.
1014023	The Cat's Lair is a bit disreputable, as it lies near the docks, but its beer is good.
1014022	The butcher can be found between the docks, near the customs house.
1014021	The Blue Boar is just North of the library, on the river.
1014020	The blacksmith North of the Miner's Guild can probably sell thee anything thou might need.
1014019	The ankh in the temple is capable of restoring life to the dead. 'Tis in northern part of town, beside the river.
1014018	The alchemist can be found with the mages in the the magic shop in front of the Main Gate.
1014017	That's the river that runs down the middle of the city.
1014016	That is the name of the old gate beside the castle moat, for once the poor came in through there to go to market. It is quite narrow.
1014015	Narrows Neck is the name for the river mouth on the southwestern side of Britain.
1014014	Lord British supports the arts. There is a public theatre across from the Bardic Conservatory.
1014013	Long ago the Narrows were dug up to meet the moat, and now 'tis fed from the water of Brittany Bay.
1014012	LB? Mayhap thou means Lord British ....
1014011	If there's not a mapmaker to be found at the Oaken Oar, then I can't help thee much.
1014010	If there be one thing Britain is not lacking, it be inns!
1014009	I know naught of thieves!
1014008	He liveth here, in Britain, in his castle.
1014007	Despite its name, the Sweet Dreams inn is quite good. It is near the Main Gate.
1014006	Britain is bounded by two rivers. The Narrows is on the west and Brittany River on the east.
1014005	Blackthorn's castle is on an island in the middle of a lake North of Britain.
1014004	Blackthorn stays out of sight mostly, sequestered in his castle up North of Britain.
1014003	An inn called Sweet Dreams lies next to the Main Gate, just East of the healer's shop.
1014002	Ah, 'tis a terrible thing, but the graveyard far to the south has become infested with the living bones of the dead.
1014001	A quite well-appointed provisioner's exists East of the river, just North of the Lighthouse.
1014000	A goodly carpenter lives not far from the market square before the castle gate.

1011454	This city is controlled by Lord British.
1011453	This city is controlled by Minax.
1011452	This city is not controlled by any faction.
1011451	The Shadow Lords are a faction that has sprung up within the ranks of Minax. Comprised mostly of undead and those who would seek to be necromancers, they pose a threat to both the sides of good and evil. Their plans have disrupted the hold Minax has over Felucca, and their ultimate goal is to destroy all life.
1011450	True Britannians are loyal to the throne of Lord British. They refuse to give up their homelands to the vile Minax, and detest the Shadowlords for their evil ways. In addition, the Council of Mages threatens the existence of their ruler, and as such they have armed themselves, and prepare for war with all.
1011449	The council of Mages have their roots in the city of Moonglow, where they once convened. They began as a small movement, dedicated to calling forth the Stranger, who saved the lands once before.  A series of war and murders and misbegotten trials by those loyal to Lord British has caused the group to take up the banner of war.
1011448	The followers of Minax have taken control in the old lands, and intend to hold it for as long as they can. Allying themselves with orcs, headless, gazers, trolls, and other beasts, they seek revenge against Lord British, for slights both real and imagined, though some of the followers wish only to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace.

1011038	Hello. I am a shopkeeper. If you would like to buy or sell any items, then simply find a shopkeeper and say to them 'VENDOR BUY' in order to see the list of items they sell, or 'VENDOR SELL' in order to see if they're interested in buying anything you own. If you do have any items in your pack that a vendor is interested in purchasing, saying 'VENDOR SELL' will cause him to look through your pack and show you a list of the items he's interested in, as well as what he'll pay for each item. If he's not interested in anything you possess, he will let you know that as well. To purchase an item, simply look through the list that appears when you say 'VENDOR BUY' and select any item you can afford. It will appear at the bottom of your list, along with a running total of your current purchases.

1011021	<center>TRAINING SKILLS</center>
1011020	Many people in town can improve your skills. To find out if I can improve skills you are interested in simply walk up to me and say 'TRAIN'. I will give you a list of the skills that I'm proficient in. To choose the skill you want to train in, say 'TRAIN' and the name of the skill you'd like to be trained in, and I will tell you the cost. Drag the gold from your backpack and drop it onto me, and your skill will be increased. If you don't have enough for the full payment, you can pay less but your training won't be as complete and you won't gain as much skill as you could if you paid the full amount. The amount of skill that can be raised is dependant on the ability of the teacher, so it is best to seek out Grand Masters when trying to learn the most about a particular skill. Remember that there is an overall limit to the amount of skills that you can learn, so you may not want to try to learn all of the skills in this manner.

1008055	I am the guildmaster of The Default Guild of Super heroic Non-Player Characters.
1008054	Welcome to the guild! Thou shalt find that fellow members shall grant thee lower prices in shops.
1008053	Welcome to the guild! Stay to the shadows, friend.
1008052	There is a fee in gold coins for joining the guild : 
1008051	Cast not one eye to the flames' disguise, for marching in order are invisible eyes.
1008050	Once a treasure was laid at the bottom of the tomb, in darkness and light, its wealth did bloom.
1008049	Brave hearts dive in and yet not return, their fate swallowed by the fires that burn.
1008048	On bended knee they came and slew, ten thousand souls for the freedom of Yew.
1008047	Beware ye who pass this way, for darkness works in mysterious ways.
1008046	Ghastly shadows on forlorn walls, echo the death of foes and falls.
1008045	The halls of fate, the halls of doom, in wells of thought, one might find room.
1008044	The clouds have reveal a philosopher, a priest and three thousand leagues of skeletons marching row by row.
1008043	Ye shant not fail, have you the eye of an eagle, the strength of an ox and the nimbleness of a wolverine.
1008042	The clouds of time reveal the ghosts of the past, still priesting over their congregation.
1008041	The cloudy mist of the all-seeing eye have revealed a path filled with still waters.
1008040	The shimmering clouds have revealed a dark destiny, one wrought with peril.
1008039	Foul beasts within, whom ye may find good company.
1008038	I know not of you, your fate is shrouded in mystery.
1008037	Your reputation doth proceed thee.
1008036	Thou hast thy bravery at least.
1008035	The treasures within, should become part of thee.
1008034	Thy traps ye find, ye shall defeat.
1008033	Thy foes ye meet, no doubt ye should harm.
1008032	I should arrest thee now, before thou dost something terrible. Thou art well known as a rogue of the worst kind.
1008031	Thou shouldst leave this city before any decide to lynch thee.
1008030	I hope that thou art merely visiting, for we mislike knaves mingling with our citizens.
1008029	Scum! Stay not overlong here, for thou art not welcome!
1008028	The guards well know thee and thy nefarious ways! be sure to behave thyself!
1008027	Look thee who crawled out from under a rock! Well, thou shalt not do anything illegal whilst I am watching thee!
1008026	Thou art a scofflaw, but while here thou SHALT obey the laws, or suffer.
1008025	Mine eye is on thee, scoundrel. Break not the law.
1008024	Thou art known as a criminal. Do not draw the attention of the guards with thy deeds, or risk death!
1008023	Thou hast an unsavory reputation--best that thou dost not prove that thou earnst it.
1008022	If I catch thee breaking laws, thy neck will be on the line.
1008021	I have heard of thee--keep thee to the straight and narrow whilest here!
1008020	Faugh, another scoundrel to keep an eye on!
1008019	I trust thee not, nor should anyone. Thou art a ruffian.
1008018	Thou hast a suspicious look about thee.
1008017	I know thy type. Break not the laws, or else suffer punishment!
1008016	We'll be keeping an eye on thee.
1008015	Don't do anything foolish.
1008014	Get out of our city, scum!
1008013	Thy sort is not welcome here. Thou hadst best run now.
1008012	'Tis a shame that thou canst not reform, for now I shall have to kill thee.
1008011	Beware, all, whilst I dispose of this evildoer.
1008010	'Twill be a pleasure to dispatch a scoundrel such as thee.
1008009	Thou hast made a fatal mistake by showing thy filthy face.
1008008	A warrant is outstanding for thy execution.
1008007	Now, I shall kill thee.
1008006	Stand back, everyone, a dastardly criminal approaches.
1008005	How nice of thee to come to meet my blade.
1008004	Flee now before I behead thee, scum!
1008003	Thou'rt wanted!
1008002	Here have some coins : 
1008001	I will pay you gold for this deed : 
1008000	For the deed I have placed gold in your bankbox : 
1007172	I be comin' home 'Lizabeth! This is the big one!
1007171	Bloody bucket ne'er had a name.
1007170	None there are to save this ship.
1007169	Ar! So this be how it ends, eh? Blasted land lubbers leavin' me to drown!
1007168	Fish feet and bird lips! We've sprung a leak! Start bailin'!
1007167	Money is always welcome.
1007166	'Tis a noble gift.
1007165	Hmm, I seem to have lost some weight.
1007164	Hmm, coal, or a fruitcake for Blackthorn?
1007163	British? Coal or a fruitcake? Hmm.
1007162	I think I'm going to cause a worldwide shortage of coal this year.
1007161	If I only had a sleigh...
1007160	Dancer, Prancer, don't wander off.
1007159	Where IS Rudolph? He's never this late.
1007158	Naughty or nice? Hmm.
1007157	I wish thee joy! Ho ho ho!
1007156	I wish thee the joy of the season!
1007155	Enjoy the season!
1007154	May the holidays be joyful!

1007148	Thy shield is in thy backpack. Be sure thou dost not lose thy reputation, or else thou shalt lose thy life with it.
1007147	I congratulate thee!
1007146	Congratulations!
1007145	'Tis a good choice.
1007144	Excellent!
1007143	Welcome to our ranks!
1007142	Excellent! Welcome to our ranks!
1007141	Sign up with a guild of order if thou art interested.
1007140	Sign up with a guild of chaos if thou art interested.
1007139	I see you are in need of our shield, Here you go.
1007138	If thou art interested in joining Lord British's guard, a place can be found for thee.
1007137	Thou'rt a good and honest person. Care to join Lord British's guard?
1007136	British's guard hath been looking for folk like thee.
1007135	Wouldst thou be interested in joining British's guard?
1007134	Thou hast the look of a likely candidate for joining Lord British's guards.
1007133	Say 'yea' if thou art interested.
1007132	If thou art interested in joining Lord Blackthorn's guard, a place can be found for thee.
1007131	Thou'rt a good and honest person. Care to join Lord Blackthorn's guard?
1007130	Blackthorn's guard hath been looking for folk like thee.
1007129	Wouldst thou be interested in joining Blackthorn's guard?
1007128	Thou hast the look of a likely candidate for joining Lord Blackthorn's guards.
1007127	 Do not dishonor us by asking again, scum.
1007126	 Thou'rt extremely close, however.
1007125	Thou dost not qualify for the virtue guards; thy record is not good enough.
1007124	Only the very best of citizens may join the guards.
1007123	Only those of utmost probity are accepted into the guards.
1007122	Thy record is not good enough to join the guards.
1007121	Thou hast not the unblemished record we expect from our members.
1007120	The guards will not accept thee until thy reputation improves.
1007119	Thou art not worthy of being a member of our fraternity.
1007118	Is not thy emblem a sign that thou art a member of our rival guards?
1007117	There is a rivalry between thy group and mine--be careful.
1007116	'Tis a pity that thou art in the wrong camp!
1007115	Tch tch... thou wearest the wrong emblem!
1007114	Art thou here to harass me?
1007113	Whilst I grant respect to thy lord, I mislike thy emblem.
1007112	Thou'rt not of my brotherhood! Away with thee!
1007111	Stay away, lest our rivalry develop into something worse!
1007110	Why dost thou ask about virtue guards when thou art one?
1007109	Isn't it wonderful being a virtue guard?
1007108	Yes, as thou knowest, it is a great thing to be one!
1007107	Hmm? Yes, I am one. So art thou.
1007106	Yes, thou'rt a virtue guard.
1007105	Hail, my friend.

1007060	Ouch! Thou didst scratch me!
1007059	Thou art no match for me!

1007052	May thy shade wander the wilderness forever!
1007051	May thy soul rest in peace.
1007050	Thou shouldst not have fought me.
1007049	So perish those who challenge me!
1007048	There, that taketh care of thee.
1007047	Thou deservest to die!
1007046	Die, pathetic fool!
1007045	Thou shouldst not have messed with me!

1007020	Tis no surprise that I'd say aye'.
1007019	A plague on thee if thou doth ask again.
1007018	If I say, 'yea', wilt thou leave?
1007017	Only a fool would ask such.

1007015	With virtue, it shall be.
1007014	'Twas not clear.

1094884	Fight the corrupted souls with sword and spell, and gather the Threads of Fate they leave behind!
1094883	I wish to undo the horrors that have beset Magincia but I need help.   There are some souls whose burden is so great that they have become corrupted and bound by the Threads of Fate.  Go to Magincia and cut the Corrupted Souls free by any means necessary, and gather the threads that they leave behind.
1094882	Ah!  With this we can hopefully undo the actions that have destroyed our precious city.  Please take this as a reminder of the consequences of action without thought.

1094879	Ah, thank you!  With this we can begin to bring life back to this land.  Take this - may it be a reminder to you that life is precious.
1094878	If you can find a restless spirit and use Spirit Speak, that may give you the ability to talk to them.

If you can speak to the Restless Souls, you may be able to help them move onward.  Bring me three of the Threads of Life that they should leave behind, and I will give you something to remember what we had forgotten.

1002171	The wrestling skill has several uses in combat and may even be used to stun opponents.  If you do not have a weapon equipped and you attack a creature, your wrestling skill will come into play.
1002170	This skill is used while in hand-to-hand combat (no weapon equipped). It is checked automatically when you fight, and may determine the frequency, and damage level with which you will strike your opponent. 
1002169	Wrestling
1002168	The veterinary skill will allow you to heal animals in much the same way that the healing skill works on people. To use the skill, simply double-click on a bandage, you will receive a targeting cursor, and then target the animal you wish to heal. The amount of healing that you provide will be based on your skill level.
1002167	Veterinary
1002166	The tracking skill will allow you to track animals, monsters, and people. Use the skill by clicking the jewel on your skill list. You will be presented with a window, which will allow you to choose what you wish to track. Double-click the category you wish to track (animal, human, or monster), and you will be presented with a second window listing the specific PCs or NPC's that you can track. If you are successful, and an appropriate creature can be tracked, you will be told in what direction that creature can be found. The higher your skill level in tracking, the more likely you are to successfully track an object, and the farther you will be able to track it.
1002165	Tracking
1002164	To place a trap on a container you must have a chest or other container, a poison potion, explosive potion, or crossbow bolt, and a small supply of metal. Use your tinker tools, then target your metal, and choose the type of trap you wish to make. Last, target the container you wish to trap. If successful, the container will become trapped, and the trap you have created will affect the next person who illegally opens this item. Using the proper key on this container will bypass the trap and allow you to open the chest safely. The strength of your trap will be directly related to your skill as a tinker.
1002163	The tinkering skill is used to make tools for other professions, and also to make clocks, sextants, and to trap containers. With this skill you can make hammers, tongs, scissors, smoothing planes, and numerous other tools. To make these tools and assorted items you will need a set of tinker's tools. First double-click on the tinker's tools, and then select your supply of metal or wood. A window will open displaying the items that you can make from the raw materials available (either wood or metal). You will need ingots for metal and boards for wood.  Some additional items may be necessary, such as gems for rings.
1002162	Tinkering
1002161	Use of Taste Identification will allow you to determine the sort of potion you have in your possession, or to determine if an object is poisoned or not. Simply use the skill from the jewel on your skill list, and then target the item you wish to taste. If successful, you will be told what kind of potion it is (if the object is a potion) or whether or not it's poisoned (if it's not a potion).
1002160	Taste ID
1002159	Once you have your raw materials, you can make a wide variety of items. You need a sewing kit to tailor these items. A sewing kit can be purchased from a tailor.  Use the sewing kit with the materials in your pack. You will be given a window presenting the categories and items that you can craft with your skill level and materials. Choose the item you wish to make, and target the material if necessary. If you are successful, the item will be placed in your pack. If you do not have room in your pack, you will be unable to create the item. As your skill level rises, you will be able to make more complex items, and your chances for success will increase. After creating some items, you may wish to dye them to increase their appeal. You can do this by purchasing a dye tub, and some dyes. Just double click the dyes and select the tub you wish to use them on, then select the color you wish the tub to be. You can then dye items by double clicking the tub, and targeting the item you wish to dye.
1002158	You may purchase cloth, or you may also find cotton lying in fields.  If you do find cotton, you may use the cotton.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select a spinning wheel to use the cotton on and it will produce cloth.
1002157	To get leather from a cow, you will need to kill it and skin it.  In order to skin the cow, use a bladed weapon on the carcass.  This will leave hides on the corpse.  You may also get hides from other animals.
1002156	Use of the tailoring skill will allow you to make a wide variety of items, ranging from bandages to clothing, and even leather armor. Your raw materials can come from a variety of sources, from hunting animals for leather, to gathering cotton and spinning thread. You can also purchase materials from a vendor and craft them into items for resale.
1002155	Tailoring
1002154	Swordsmanship, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the appropriate weapon equipped, you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002153	Only the one-handed weapons of a swordsman can be poisoned.  You must be careful when using a poison weapon, as the poison will damage the weapon and make it more likely to break.
1002152	Swordsmanship is a melee combat skill, which allows for a strong-arm attack style of fighting.  A swordsperson is capable of using an axe, a battle axe, a double axe, an executioner's axe, a hatchet, a large battle axe, a pickaxe, a two-handed axe, a butcher knife, a cleaver, a skinning knife, a bardiche, a halberd, a broad sword, a cutlass, a katana, a longsword, a scimitar, or a viking sword in combat to slice there opponents to ribbons.
1002151	Swordsmanship
1002150	As mentioned above, you will not be able to steal from other players unless you are a member of the thieves guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. You can join the thieves guild in the usual manner, by finding a Thief Guildmaster and asking him to join. There will be an entrance fee, and there are several entrance requirements. Your character must have adventured in the world for at least one week, must not have any murders to his name, and must have already demonstrated proficiency in stealing (60 skill minimum). The requirements to stay in the guild are stringent as well. If you are reported for murder, you will be summarily ejected from the guild, and cannot rejoin for one week. Also, once you join the guild, you cannot leave for one week, unless ejected from the guild. Thieves Guild members cannot report murders, and thus could be considered "freely" attackable anywhere in the world (except in justice regions, unless they steal from another player).
1002149	If your attempt is noticed, the guards can be called on you, so you must be very careful when attempting these practices. It is also important to note that for two minutes after stealing, the member of the Thieves' Guild is freely attackable by anyone in the area. In towns, the proscription against starting fights still applies, so even Thieves' Guild members will be safe from random attack, even if everyone knows of their affiliation.
1002148	#NAME?
1002147	#NAME?
1002146	#NAME?
1002145	-  True Success: you get the item and are not noticed
1002144	There are four possible outcomes to stealing:
1002143	The skilled Pickpocket may be able to steal items in several manners, from a variety of sources. You may be able to steal from monsters, chests, NPC's, or other players (if you are a member of the thieves guild, or if they are an opponent in a guild war). You can attempt to steal in two ways. First, use the skill from your skill list, and target the container, creature, NPC, or player. This is a 'random steal' and will attempt to steal an item at random from this source. The second method is to first 'snoop' the container using your snooping skill, and then select a specific object to steal. Dragging this item into your inventory will check your stealing skill to determine your chances of success. The skilled pickpocket must be very dexterous in his or her work, and will find that the more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal.
1002142	Stealing
1002141	Spirit Speak is used to be able to understand the speech of ghosts. If you do not have this skill you will only be able to see a series of "oooooo"s emanating from the deceased. To use this skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and if you are successful you will be able to understand the ghost. Keep in mind that the length of time the interpretation lasts is directly related to the level of skill you have attained and your level of intelligence.
1002140	Spirit Speak
1002139	The Snooping skill is used to see into another player's backpack. To use the snooping skill, simply double click on another player's pack, and if you are successful, the pack will appear open to you on the screen. Be warned however that a large majority of players do not care for a player who frequents the use of this skill. This skill is best used in conjunction with stealing. To steal from other players, you must be a member of the thief's guild.
1002138	Snooping
1002137	The skilled rogue will be able to disarm traps using the Remove Trap skill. In order to begin learning the art of removing traps you must first demonstrate proficiency at Lockpicking, and Detect Hidden. You must have a base level of 50 skill in both of those skills before you can begin your training in this area. To use the Remove Trap skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the item that you wish to disarm. If you are successful in your attempt, you will disarm the trap. Failure to disarm the trap stands the possibility of setting off the trap. The higher your skill level, the more difficult the trap you can disarm. You must be very careful when using this skill, it can be quite a risky proposition. To disarm traps, you must be quite nimble, and will find that wearing gloves makes this process much more difficult.
1002136	Remove Trap
1002135	Foul smelling but powerful, sulphurous ash is a dusty volcanic residue. It is found mainly in Britannia's mountainous regions and is a common element of any spell releasing fire, light, or explosive energy.
1002134	Spider's silk is an inexpensive reagent, as it is quite plentiful and light on one's back, even in large quantities. However, it is so fine that massive amounts of fibers are consumed by a single spell. True to its origin as webbing, this reagent calls forth summoning and binding spells.
1002133	The nightshade plant is as deadly as its long-standing reputation. Its touch can poison a human; in a magical spell, it invokes powers of death, damage and illusion.
1002132	Mandrake Root is harder to find than other reagents, although it is probably the most commonly used of the eight base reagents. Like blood moss, it thrives in dark, dank, areas, where most dare not venture. Those that do search out this precious root are rewarded by being able to cast spells invoking strength and energy.
1002131	Ginseng is hailed as the reagent of health, as its syrup bestows both healing and restoration. Common Britannia folk use it as a home remedy for fatigue and sickness, but true magicians appreciate ginseng for its magical qualities and always keep a healthy portion on hand.
1002130	The ground paste of a ripe bulb of garlic has a reputation for warding off evil. This effect accurately describes its use as a reagent as well. Modern magicians use garlic in spells that protect the caster (or a specified target) or dispel danger.
1002129	Blood Moss takes its name from its reddish color. Prevalent in wetter surroundings (such as marshes or swamps), this type of fungi is a base reagent for spells involving locomotion or animation.
1002128	Black Pearls are rare, and are often referred to as the reagent of movement. When finely ground into a powder, black pearls can invoke spells that teleport of propel the caster to another location.
1002127	Reagents
1002126	This skill is used to encourage other creatures to fight one other. You will need a musical instrument to accomplish this task. To use the skill, first select the provocation skill from the skills list, target the instrument you wish to use (or the game will remember the one you last used), and then click in turn on each of the creatures you wish to fight one another. If you are successful the two creatures will fight for a time consistent with their respective natures and dispositions. Please keep in mind that you cannot provoke other characters.
1002125	Provocation
1002124	When you wish to poison an item, DO NOT double click the green potion first. If you do this, you will drink the poison. This does not give you the results you had hoped for, as you will have just poisoned yourself.
1002123	The poisoning skill can be used to poison a weapon or even food and drink. This will cause damage to whoever is attacked with the poisoned weapon, or to whoever consumes the food or drink. To poison a weapon simply use the skill from your skill list, and then select the vial of poison you wish to use, and finally click on the item you wish to poison. If you poison a weapon, you will lose karma.  This item will now be poisoned until you use it. Once the poisoned weapon is used you will have to repeat the process to poison it again. The same process is used to poison food or drink. Select the skill and then click on the vial of poison. Then click on the consumable, and presto! The food or drink is now poisoned for a period of time. To create the vial of poison you will need to have the reagent nightshade, and then mix it in pestle and mortar. Once it is mixed, it will pour into the empty bottle in your pack. You can then use this green potion to poison items.
1002122	Poisoning
1002121	Use of the peacemaking skill will allow you to stop all fights in your immediate area. This skill is related to your musicianship skill, and will automatically check this skill when you use peacemaking. To use the skill, you must click the jewel in your skills list, and then click on your instrument (or the game will remember the last instrument that you played). If you are successful, all fights in the immediate area will stop, at least for a moment. The higher your musicianship and peacemaking skills, the more likely you are to be successful.
1002120	Peacemaking
1002119	This skill is used to determine your proficiency at blocking attacks with a shield. If you are using a shield, this skill is checked automatically each time that you are attacked. If successful, your attacker may miss his attack, or do less damage than normal.
1002118	Parrying
1002117	Use of the musicianship skill will allow you to play an instrument. The ability to play an instrument is necessary for some other skills such as discordance, provocation, and peacemaking. To use this skill, simply double click the instrument of your choice. A music sample will play if you succeed, but an ugly noise will occur if you fail. The higher your skill level, the greater your chances of playing a pretty tune.
1002116	Musicianship
1002115	A miner who is also a tinker will often be able to be self-sufficient.  Tinkers are able to create shovels and pickaxes necessary for miners.
1002114	The rarity and chances of finding various ores varies directly with the skill level necessary to mine it. The more rare the ore, the higher the skill level necessary to mine it.
1002113	To mine ore you must have either a shovel or a pickaxe in your possession. Double-click on the axe or shovel and then, when the targeting cursor appears, click on a mountainside or a cave wall. If successful, you will mine either a small, medium, or large pile of ore, dependent upon a number of factors. The known ore types, in order of their prevalence, are Iron (the most common), Dull Copper, Shadow Iron, Copper, Bronze, Golden, Agapite, Verite, and Valorite.
1002112	Cultivating the mining skill enables you to harvest the seams of ore that lie in the mines and mountains of Britannia. This ore can then be smelted into ingots (using the mining skill) and the ingots can then be used to craft various items, such as armor (using the blacksmithing skill).
1002111	Mining
1002110	Mages benefit greatly from meditation and evaluate intelligence skills.  Meditation improves the rate at which a mage regains lost mana and evaluate intelligence allows a mage to overcome an opponent's resistance to the mage's magic.
1002109	It is also possible to cast a spell from a scroll. The proper reagents and skill are necessary to prepare the scroll initially, so casting from a scroll requires no reagents, and can be done with a lower level of skill.
1002108	If your spellbook does not contain a spell you wish to use often, simply acquire a scroll for that spell, and drag it into your spellbook. This spell will be added to the spells available for your use from this book.
1002107	This skill will allow you to cast a variety of spells in the game. The magery skill is automatically checked when you attempt to cast a spell, and your skill level will determine your chances of success in the attempt. To cast a spell, your hands must be free of any items (except a spellbook), you must have a spellbook with the appropriate spell contained therein, and you must have the appropriate reagents in your pack. Simply open the spellbook, choose the spell that you wish to cast, and double click the spell name. You can also click once on the spell name to get a more complete description of the spell, along with a 'tile' that represents the spell. If you wish, you can 'drag' the tile to your play area, and cast the spell by double clicking on the tile. Depending on the spell that you cast, you will be given different options for the next step, but the success or failure of your casting depends on your magery level.
1002106	Magery
1002105	Mace fighting, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.
1002104	Due to the heavy bashing of a mace weapon, mace fighters have the ability to damage the armor of their opponents and remove their stamina.
1002103	Mace fighting is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A mace fighter is capable of using a War Axe, Club, Hammer Pick, Mace, Magic Wand, Maul, Smithy Hammer, War Hammer, War Mace, Black Staff, Gnarled Staff, Quarterstaff, and Shepherd's Crook in combat to great effect.
1002102	Mace Fighting
1002101	The use of the lumberjacking skill will allow you to gain raw materials in the form of logs. The logs can then be used for carpentry, bowyering, or tinkering. Simply equip a hatchet or an axe, double click the weapon and then click on a tree. If you are successful in recovering wood it will be placed in your pack.
1002100	Lumberjacking
1002099	This skill is especially useful in hunting treasure from treasure maps. The treasure chests that are found will be locked and often trapped. Use of this skill along with detect hidden (to find any traps) will prove useful.
1002098	The lockpicking skill is exactly that, it is used to open locked items. In order to attempt to pick a lock, you must have a set of lockpicks in your pack. Lockpicks can be purchased from thief shopkeepers.  Double-click on your lockpicks, and then target the item to be picked. Some locks are harder to pick than others (and some, such as house doors, are impossible to pick). Your skill level will determine your success rate.  If you are successful the lock will be picked, and you can open the item.
1002097	Lockpicking

1000063	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You can fight with just your fists, but to do more damage, you should use a weapon. To use one you must first equip it. A cutlass has been placed in your backpack for you to use. Open your paperdoll (Double left click on your avatar), and open your backpack. (Double left click on the backpack). To equip it we need to pick it up. Left click, hold and drag the cutlass out of the backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000062	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to go into <B>Combat</B> mode. Combat mode will allow you to attack monsters and other players.

1000061	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the Monster's status bar. It only shows the monster's Health.

1000059	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue following the blue footprints.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000058	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You have sold the bread! The appropriate amount of gold has been placed in your backpack and was neatly collected back into your stack of gold. Now that you are familiar with buying and selling from NPC's, let's move on to some combat! Follow the blue footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000057	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The <B>Sell</B> window is arranged the same way as the Buy window. Instead of the shopkeeper's items at the top of the window, <B>your</B> items are listed. Double-click the left mouse button on the loaf of bread description. It will appear in the bottom portion of the window. Note the amount the NPC will pay for the bread is around half of what you originally paid for it. Now single left click on the large Checkmark to finish the sale. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000056	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great! Now you have a loaf of bread in your backpack. But you are also a few gold poorer. You only have 4 gold now. You can sell items to NPC's as well. They won't pay as much for an item as it is worth though. It's just not profitable for them! Let's sell the loaf of bread back to the NPC. Type <B>Vendor Sell</B>, and press the enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000055	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The available loaves of bread has been dropped by one and a loaf of bread has been placed in the bottom portion of the window.

1000053	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To let a NPC shopkeeper know you wish to buy from them, you must type in <B>Vendor Buy</B>. Type this in now and press the Enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000052	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now close your Paperdoll. (HINT: Single right click on it.). Your backpack will remain open. Inside of your backpack you will see some <B>Gold</B>.

1000051	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to buy and sell from an NPC. NPC's respond to speech, just like players do, but they require gold for their wares.

1000050	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The NPC paperdoll shows information about the NPC just as yours does. The clothing and equipment worn are shown as well as the NPC's name and profession.

1000048	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue to follow the footprints into the next room. Inside you will see a number of avatars. These are NPC's, or Non-Player Characters. NPC's are avatars that are run by the game. In this case, these NPC's are <B>Shopkeepers</B>. Shopkeepers will buy and sell items from players. Walk over to one of the NPC's and stand right next to them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000047	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now that you are more familiar with your character, close the Status window with a single right click. Now follow the Red footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000046	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next are the number values of Health, Stamina and Mana. Below that is <B>Gold</B>. This tells you how much money you currently have. Below that is <B>Weight</B>. Weight is an indicator of how much you are carrying. The more weight you are carrying, the more stamina you will lose during normal physical activity. Excessive weight will prevent you from moving at all! Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000045	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next, <B>SEX</B> shows whether your character is Male or Female. Below that is <B>AR</B> or Armor Rating. AR represents how well protected your character is. The higher the AR, the better protected from damage you are. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000044	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last Statistic is <B>INT</B> which is for your <B>Intelligence</B>. This represents how smart you are. A character with a high Intelligence will excel at mental activities such as spell casting. Intelligence also determines the amount of Mana that you have available. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000043	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next statistic is <B>DEX</B> which stands for your <B>Dexterity</B>. This represents how agile and quick you are. If your Dexterity is very high, you will be able to dodge attacks, and perform physical activities more quickly. Dexterity also affects the amount of Stamina you have. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000042	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>As you can see this window gives you much more detail about your character. It gives you the number value of your current and maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina, as well as several other statistics. The first statistic, <B>STR</B> is your <B>Strength</B>. This is a measure of how strong and durable your avatar is. The higher your strength is, the more Health you have, and the more you excel at physical activity. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000041	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to take a closer look at your status. The Status Bar can be maximized to a more detailed Status window by double left clicking on the bar. Maximize the bar now. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000040	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last characteristic is the bottom bar. This bar measures your current <B>Stamina</B>. The stamina bar lets you know how tired you are. Running, fighting, and other physical activities will decrease your stamina. Be careful not to let your stamina reach 0, as you will become too tired to move! Stamina, just like Health and Mana, regenerates over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000039	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next characteristic, shown as the middle bar, is <B>Mana</B>. Mana shows you how much magical energy that your character has available. Casting a spell will decrease your available Mana. Mana regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000038	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your Health has been lowered to half. See how the bar is now half blue and half red? The blue portion of the bar shows you how close you are to your maximum in that characteristic. So if you have very little blue left, watch out! Your other characteristics will work the same way. Health regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue and restore your Health to full. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000037	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your <B>Status Bar</B>. It is a handy representation of your avatar's characteristics. There are 3 major characteristics shown here. The first, and most important is the topmost bar. This represents your avatar's <B>Health</B>. Health shows you how hurt your character is. Your Health decreases when you are wounded. As your Health drops lower, the blue bar will shrink. Let's see what this looks like. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000036	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn more about your avatar. Move the mouse cursor over your avatar. Now single click the left mouse button, hold it down, and drag the cursor off of your character. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000035	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you'll have a chance to use a little of what you have just learned. Inside of this room is a Red <B>Moongate</B>. A Moongate is a magical portal, which will teleport you elsewhere. The moongate is inside the smaller room with 8 doors. Walk over to these doors, and <B>Use</B> them.

1000034	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To reopen your paperdoll, simply double left click on your avatar. Now you know how to move, minimize, restore, and close all of the windows available to you. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000033	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll learn how to <B>Close</B> a window. To close any window, simply single right click on it. Single right click on your paperdoll window. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000032	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the paperdoll has shrunk down to a button-looking window that says <B>Character</B>? This is the minimized version of the paperdoll window. It can be moved around by left clicking and dragging just like any other window. To restore the paperdoll, you just double left click on the Character window. Double left click on it now.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000031	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>First, look in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. Do you see the <B>Dash symbol (-)</B>? This is the <B>Minimize</B> button. It appears on almost all of the windows in Ultima Online. Single left clicking on it will shrink down the window for convenience. Left click on the paperdoll minimize button, or dash symbol. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000030	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>

1000027	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have <B>Equipped</B> the hat. See how it appears on your avatar as well as your paperdoll?

Move the mouse cursor over the hat on your paperdoll, and left click and hold down the mouse button to pick it up. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000026	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have dropped the hat! I have returned it to your backpack. Try to pick up the hat again. Do this by moving the cursor over it, and left clicking and holding down the button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000025	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now holding the hat. Be careful! You don't want to release the mouse button, as that would drop it. Drag the hat over to your head in the paperdoll and release the button. Doing this will <B>Equip</B> the hat. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>
1000024	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>YUM! You ate the banana. There is now a blue Hat in your backpack. Clothing and other equipment can be worn and removed.

1000023	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you know how to <B>Move</B> an object in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world.

1000020	<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the description appears above the object? You can look at any object in the world with a single left click. Let's learn how to pick up things.
