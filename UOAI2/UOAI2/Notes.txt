Top Priorities:
1:	Complete UOAI2 communication with injected dll

2:	Finish the UOAI.Item class and make a binary tree class for storing and
	accessing UOAI.ItemList.
	
3:	Add packet classes for other types of packets.

	-	I changed the event handler model to use a "ClientSocket" class to handle packets
		Its pretty much the same as before but there is not loop, I made this change because
		I noticed that the core that had the client running on it was getting its cpu eaten
		up by the loop. So, it turns out that I was right, the loop AND the timer eats CPU 
		like a fat kid eats cake. So now, when a packet is recieved it calls the sub:
		
		Private Sub _EventSocket_Receive(ByVal buffer() As Byte) Handles _EventSocket.Receive
		
		Which then handles the packet by one iteration of the same stuff inside the old 
		EventHandler sub. This may not be the best way to deal with it, but I dont see any obvious
		draw-backs. Though I will have to do some stuff "disconnect" from the client injected
		dll when the test app is shut down, that way it wont keep trying to have the host app do shit.
		
	-	I am having trouble getting past the "Entering Britania..." screen when connecting to
		UOGamers. After i exit the app, it connects and then i get a message from the server (custom
		gump with a message) saying that I am using an unrecognized client and disconnects me
		after 5 seconds. Also none of the walls in my house or anything load up, i just have plot
		on the ground and a bunch of shit floating above it. I will try to fix this... failed.
		
	-	Is there some sort of message that I am supposed to send to the injected dll to tell it
		to stop redirecting packets? I dont know...
		
	-	Also try to be carefull when defining subs, I dont know about COM or C#, but the visiblity
		of the Sub to the user is determined like so:
		
		Private Sub	- Can only be accessed form within that class
		Friend Sub	- Can be accessed by anything inside of the UOAI Class
		Public Sub	- Can be accessed by the end user (the test app)
		
		You don't want people to get confused and start to call things like Client.HandlePacket or
		Client.RemoveObject(0) and make UOAI do some wierd shit.

	-	I excluded the interfaces.vb file, we don't need it.. and it was generating errors.
		The file is still there it's just removed form the project listing.
		
	-	I exluded the UOClientDll.dll project, we need to use the VC6 compiled one the VS2008
		compiled version crashes whenever the hooks are called (packet-sent/receive). Probably
		the code around the inline assembly messes up some assumptions i make in the inline
		assembly part.
		
	-	I finished the basic layout of the event-part... i think however we should switch from
		a threaded to a timer-based one. As you can see it doesn't shut down correctly otherwise.
		
	-	The onPacketReceive event is now working, though you only get the UnicodePacket right now...
		and some bugs in either the packet-parsing of the unicode text thing; or in the converted bufferhandler
		cause the unicode packet to have only the .Name set correctly. .Text fails.
