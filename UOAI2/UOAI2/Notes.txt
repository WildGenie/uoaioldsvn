Top Priorities:
1:	UOAI2 communication with injected dll, to where we can get information
	from the clients memory and make a "UOAI.Item" object that has data that 
	can be used by the test application. (fe. Item.Type)

2:	Finish the UOAI.Item class and make a binary tree class for storing and
	accessing UOAI.ItemList.
	
	
Completed Recently:
-	Added UOAI.Client layout, just added the subs and functions and such for when
	we can get more information for it to use.
-

	- I excluded the interfaces.vb file, we don't need it.. and it was generating errors.
		The file is still there it's just removed form the project listing.
	- I exluded the UOClientDll.dll project, we need to use the VC6 compiled one the VS2008
		compiled version crashes whenever the hooks are called (packet-sent/receive). Probably
		the code around the inline assembly messes up some assumptions i make in the inline
		assembly part.
	- I finished the basic layout of the event-part... i think however we should swith from
		a threaded to a timer-based one. As you can see it doesn't shut down correctly otherwise.
	- The onPacketReceive event is now working, though you only get the UnicodePacket right now...
		and some bugs in either the packet-parsing of the unicode text thing; or in the converted bufferhandler
		cause the unicode packet to have only the .Name set correctly. .Text fails.
